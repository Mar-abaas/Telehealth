Georgia,2021.0,Q1,"President Biden, speaking from the White House, reached for a little optimism. The early coronavirus mistakes were mostly mistakes of excessive optimism. Many scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, did not immediately grasp the threat. Neither did we in the media.

Some politicians continue to show undue optimism, ending mask mandates and allowing full restaurants."

Georgia,2021.0,Q2,"For each person who dies of Covid-19, experts say there are at least nine newly bereaved. We must begin to address the toll. The end of the Covid-19 crisis in the United States is in sight, thanks to effective vaccines being deployed on a massive scale.

Georgia,2021.0,Q2,"In 15 states, including Arkansas, the Carolinas, Georgia and Louisiana, about half of adults or fewer have received a vaccine dose.

Georgia,2021.0,Q2,"A company with Southern roots and global reach tries to find its voice on an issue that disproportionately affects Black voters. When James Quincey became chief executive of Coca-Cola in 2017, it’s fair to say he wasn’t focused on how to articulate the company’s position on the issue of voting rights. Instead, Mr. Quincey, who grew up in Birmingham, England, and has spent most of his career outside the United States, was consumed with the usual C.E.O. fare — expanding the business, keeping the share price up and not damaging the brand."
Georgia,2021.0,Q2,"The author of a new study said the combination of blackouts and extreme heat “may be the deadliest climate-related event we can imagine.” WASHINGTON — The growing risk of overlapping heat waves and power failures poses a severe threat that major American cities are not prepared for, new research suggests."

Matthew Boedy, an associate professor of rhetoric and composition, sent out a raw emotional appeal to his students at the University of North Georgia just before classes began: The Covid-19 Delta variant was rampaging through the state, filling up hospital beds. He would teach class in the equivalent of full body armor — vaccinated and masked."

Georgia,2021.0,Q3,"School reopenings tend to do well in areas with high vaccination rates, but the picture is very different for schools in areas with lower rates. New York City public schools are reopening at a time when some schools in other states are already several weeks into in-person teaching.

Georgia,2021.0,Q4,"The agency has taken a controversial stand on vaping as a way to quit tobacco. This is what the research shows. When they first appeared in the United States in the mid-2000s, “electronic nicotine delivery systems” — e-cigarettes, vapes, e-liquids and other wares that contain the stimulant found in tobacco — were subject to little federal oversight. Their makers could incorporate countless other ingredients and flavorings. Like cigarettes before them, the devices proved extremely attractive to young people; in 2018, the surgeon general declared youth vaping an “epidemic” and noted that one in five high schoolers and one in 20 middle schoolers used e-cigarettes. Nicotine can harm the developing brain, and e-cigarettes contain potentially harmful toxins like heavy metals; the long-term effects of vaping — the heating of nicotine to create an inhaled aerosol — are uncertain."

Georgia,2022.0,Q1,"Senators Cory Booker, Tim Scott and Raphael Warnock brought vastly different perspectives to proceedings that highlighted the Senate’s striking lack of diversity.

Hawaii,2020.0,Q3,"Long thought to have medicinal benefits, fungi including reishi, lion’s mane and chaga are gaining popularity in the wellness world. Even before the onset of the pandemic, which has increased the demand for all manner of so-called organic immunity elixirs, wellness-minded Americans were warming to mushrooms. To be clear, mushrooms don’t cure Covid-19, but they are thought to provide a host of other benefits, from serving as an aphrodisiac to bolstering one’s defenses to toxins. As Ligaya Mishan explains in her essay for T’s Fall Men’s issue, Eastern cultures have long been enthusiastic about edible fungi, both in culinary and health contexts — mushrooms are rich in umami, the Japanese “fifth taste” that denotes savoriness, and woody species such as reishi are often prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine — while the West has been more ambivalent. Today, though, American cooks and diners delight in foraged morels and matsutakes, while others mix mushroom-based powders into shakes and teas. In an article published in 2014 — over 80 years after the British scientist Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, the powerful group of antibiotics derived from the fungus Penicillium — the mycologist Paul Stamets, best known for the TED Talk “6 Ways Mushrooms Can Save the World,” described mushrooms as “nature’s miniature pharmaceutical factories.”"

Even after a small Chinatown emerged near the Strip, Ms. Lin and her sister-in-law would pile their children into a van every few months and drive four hours through the desert to Los Angeles to stock up on the specialty groceries they needed to make their family’s beloved Cantonese dishes."
Hawaii,2022.0,Q4,Earlier mornings and shorter evening light can be a tough adjustment. But there are ways to prepare for the end of daylight saving. The transition to fall is scattered with seasonal markers: The occasional chill in the air; the wearing of the flannel shirt to the pumpkin patch; the urge to make soup.
Hawaii,2022.0,Q4,"While other N.F.L. owners sail on their yachts far from prying eyes, Jim Irsay roams the country showing his museum-quality memorabilia and jamming with rock legends. Jim Irsay is not your typical team owner, especially in the buttoned-up National Football League."

Hawaii,2022.0,Q4,"As concerns about labor force participation among American men mount, maritime transportation firms are desperate for new mariners. Before dawn on a recent day in the port of Seattle, dense autumn fog hugged Puget Sound and ship-to-shore container cranes hovered over the docks like industrial sentinels. Under the dim glimmer of orange floodlights, the crew of the tugboat Millennium Falcon fired up her engines for a long day of towing oil barges and refueling a variety of large vessels, like container ships."

Hawaii,2023.0,Q1,"The marquee committee of the new Republican majority opened its first hearing by rehashing complaints about the treatment of former President Donald J. Trump and others. Even Fox News cut away. WASHINGTON — When hard-right Republicans extracted concessions from Speaker Kevin McCarthy in exchange for supporting his election last month, one of their top demands was that he robustly fund and give sweeping jurisdiction to a special subcommittee to investigate their claims of pervasive bias in the federal government against conservatives."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q1,"The legislative calendar is packed with 300 abortion bills. “You can’t go to jail for screwing up an appendectomy,” one lawmaker said. For the first time since the fight over abortion access was kicked to the states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, newly elected legislatures around the country are coming into session and are putting the polarizing issue at the top of their agendas. Around 300 bills in 40 states have been proposed so far — with a majority seeking to restrict access to abortion, and others trying to strengthen it."

Hawaii,2023.0,Q1,"A conversation with the five-time Grammy-winning singer who is the subject of a new career-spanning documentary, “Dionne Warwick: Don’t Make Me Over.” Dionne Warwick refuses to stay put. At 82, the five-time Grammy-winning artist is making stops in Hawaii and Vancouver on her One Last Time tour — she won’t say whether it’s truly her last — tweeting (or “twoting,” as she calls it) to her more than half a million followers, and making appearances on “S.N.L.” and on movie soundtracks like Jordan Peele’s “Nope.” When she retires, she said, she’ll move to Brazil."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q1,"The justices found that the state’s Constitution does not include a right to the procedure, bringing an end to a monthslong legal battle. Idaho’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition on abortion in a ruling Thursday night that said the State Constitution does not include a right to the procedure."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q1,"Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania opened 92 percent of state government jobs to people without four-year degrees. Gov. Jim Pillen of Nebraska created a state office focused on broadband access. After a midterm election year in which statewide races were almost entirely wrapped up in national issues — abortion and democracy — the nation’s newly elected governors are showing their ambitions with a mix of virtue-signaling on national issues, currying favor with their political bases and, for some, reaching out to broader constituencies."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q1,"A scramble to mine the deep sea could soon commence. And once it begins, there will be little hope of reining it in. Descending to the depths of the ocean is part of my job as a deep-sea biologist. Traveling three miles below the sea surface never ceases to uplift me. I’ve seen strange and wonderful creatures, from anemones with seven-foot tentacles that billow across the seafloor, to sharks that glow in the dark, 1,000-year-old corals and blind white crabs sustained by bacteria they cultivate on their claws."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."

Hawaii,2023.0,Q2,"The Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade has produced some unexpected legal and political changes, as well as a shift in public opinion. In the year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, some of the results of the decision have been unsurprising — more than a dozen Republican-led states have moved to ban most abortions, and dozens of abortion clinics have closed. Yet there have also been unexpected legal and political changes that have left Americans on both sides of the issue scrambling to adapt. Here are five major changes detailed in The New York Times’s coverage of the first anniversary of the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ended the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q2,"In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities.

Hawaii,2023.0,Q2,"In the 1990s, the U.S. government limited what young people could see online, but lost a court fight challenging those rules. Now it’s happening again. Mounting concerns over young people’s mental health have prompted state legislatures across the country to propose a slew of age restrictions to protect minors online. Lawmakers say the rules should help shield young people from online pornography, predators and harmful social media posts."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q2,"Revelations that migrant children have been exploited for cheap labor brought calls for action, but a partisan battle over immigration policy has complicated lawmakers’ efforts. Weeks after revelations that migrant children are being regularly exploited for cheap labor in the United States prompted bipartisan outrage and calls to action on Capitol Hill, Congress has moved no closer to addressing the issue, which has become mired in a long-running partisan war over immigration policy."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q2,"Also, American miscalculations in Sudan. Two explosions occurred 15 minutes apart over the Kremlin early yesterday, video footage verified by The Times showed. The incident set off a flurry of accusations and escalated tensions between Russia and Ukraine."

Hawaii,2023.0,Q2,"Greg Gutfeld has installed his brand of insult conservatism as the institutional voice for the next generation of Fox News viewer. And it’s catching on. One evening in May, the most-watched man in late-night television these days staked out a curious if characteristic position: A 38-year-old teacher who allegedly had sex with a 16-year-old student, the host said, was the hero this nation needed."

Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"Maui County’s lawsuit against some of the world’s largest oil and gas companies is still winding its way through state court. The words were strikingly prescient: Because of climate change, lush and verdant Maui was facing wildfires of “increased frequency, intensity, and destructive force.”"
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"As President Biden arrives to survey the damage with state and local officials, shock and grief are giving way to anger and questions about the government’s preparation. It was the firestorm that wildfire experts and residents on Maui had warned about for years — a blaze fueled by hurricane winds roaring through untamed grasses and into a 13,000-person coastal town with few ways in or out. Local officials had released plan after plan acknowledging that wildfire was all but certain."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"Nearly 60 percent of Lahaina students haven’t enrolled in classes after the deadly fire, and families are yearning to rebuild their school network for educational and emotional support. The flames that ripped through Lahaina needed only a few hours to take nearly everything from Aina Kohler. Her house. Her surfing school and cafe. And her parents’ home, where she was raised."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"The court ruled that women seeking abortion pills must first see a doctor in person. The catch: The nearest abortion doctor is an eight-hour flight away. A federal appeals court ruled late Tuesday that women on the American territory of Guam who are seeking medication abortion must first have an in-person consultation with a doctor, which is likely to make access to the procedure on the remote island even more difficult."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"“We’re the last resort,” one young activist said. As Kaliko Teruya was coming home from her hula lesson on August 8, her father called. The apartment in Lahaina was gone, he said, and he was running for his life."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"Still, there are fewer than 200 cases nationally each year, and the numbers have fallen significantly from the peak decades ago. Leprosy, a fearsome scourge of ancient civilizations, may have become a permanent fixture in Florida, according to a new study."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"The toll from wildfires in Hawaii. More than 50 people have died in devastating wildfires on the Hawaii island of Maui. Survivors described fleeing for their lives from a fast-moving “total inferno” that left the town of Lahaina in smoking ruins. Thousands of people filled evacuation shelters, and tourists continued a grim exodus to the airport."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"So far, 24 states have eliminated sales taxes on period products that have been criticized as discriminatory. On Friday, a bipartisan Texas bill that eliminates sales taxes on menstrual products went into effect, making it the 24th state in the country, as well as District of Columbia, to remove what is colloquially known as the “tampon tax.”"
Hawaii,2023.0,Q3,"In the United States, smoke from wildfires is undoing progress from the Clean Air Act. In poorer countries, the situation is even worse.

Hawaii,2023.0,Q4,"That might not be great for the long-term financial health of the country. If there is a war of the generations, we older Americans are winning it. As evidence, I present two remarkable charts, which are my versions of charts made by the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging at the University of California, Berkeley."
Hawaii,2023.0,Q4,"A form of worship constantly on display. HBO’s three-part docuseries “Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God” begins with sirens and a scream. Grainy bodycam footage captures police officers making their way through a small Colorado house to a bedroom decorated with colored string lights shaped like flowers. On the bed is a body covered by a sleeping bag. Only a face is visible. The skin is blue and the eyes are missing, their sockets surrounded by glitter. Documentaries about cults don’t often end on a high note, but few start with the leader decomposing in her own bed, surrounded by twinkle lights. "
Hawaii,2023.0,Q4,"Dr. Connor Bowman was charged with murder after investigators found that his wife, Betty Bowman, was poisoned with a drug that he had researched online.

Hawaii,2023.0,Q4,"Joseph Emerson, charged with attempted murder, said he felt trapped in a dream after taking mushrooms. He had feared mental health treatments that could disrupt his career.

The coronavirus pandemic has done what generations of overbearing parents and coaches have failed to do: send millions of boys and girls to the sideline."
Idaho,2020.0,Q1,"Fear-ridden dogs and cats at the hospital may get toys to distract them or a range of menu options. Joanna Miller’s 14-year-old miniature Doberman, Tito, would snap or try to bite anyone at the vet’s office who tried to check his eyes, ears or teeth, “pretty much everything they needed to do,” she said. Muzzling him only made his fear and anxiety worse."
Idaho,2020.0,Q1,"Their struggles were hard enough before the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic hasn’t helped. LeVar Newsom is a full-time physical education and health teacher in San Antonio, but his workday doesn’t end when the bell rings at 3:20 p.m. On days when he’s not coaching football, soccer or basketball, he drives straight to his job as a carpet cleaner, where he works from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Then he goes home to grade papers and prepare lessons. Until recently, he also worked a night shift as a hospital technician — 10:45 p.m. to 6:45 a.m. — before returning to school by 7:15 a.m. He barely saw his wife and two young daughters."

Idaho,2020.0,Q2,"Ignoring Freedom of Information Act requests during the crisis damages democracy.

CHICAGO — Officials in at least 20 states have committed in recent days to opening coronavirus vaccine appointments to all adults in March or April, part of a fast-moving expansion as states race to meet President Biden’s goal of universal eligibility by May 1."

Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"It reached 115 degrees in Portland, Ore., on Monday, the second day in a row that the city has broken a heat record. Salem, Ore., and Seattle also set records. A heat dome has enveloped the Pacific Northwest, driving temperatures to extreme levels — with temperatures well above 100 degrees — and creating dangerous conditions in a part of the country unaccustomed to oppressive summer weather or air-conditioning."
Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"Republican lawmakers in more than 30 states have introduced dozens of measures this year, the highest number of anti-transgender bills ever filed in a single year. Lawmakers in Alabama and North Dakota on Thursday approved bans on transgender girls and women competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, joining a series of Republican-led states that have focused on a rapidly growing culture clash over restricting transgender athletes and prohibiting gender-affirming medical treatments this legislative session."
Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"Since March 2020, New York Times reporters have tracked every known coronavirus case in every correctional setting in the nation. More than 2,700 inmates have died.

Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"The Biden administration will for now maintain a historically low refugee cap. But after a widespread backlash from Democrats, the White House said it would raise refugee admissions in May. WASHINGTON — The White House announced on Friday that President Biden would limit the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year to the historically low level set by the Trump administration, reversing an earlier promise to welcome more than 60,000 people fleeing war and persecution."
Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"Health concerns, expanded jobless benefits and still being needed at home are among the reasons would-be workers might be staying away. There are two distinct, and completely opposite, ways of looking at the American job market."
Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"Recent conservative legislation has targeted a class of drugs used to treat transgender adolescents. But what do these drugs actually do? When Sebastian Liafsha came out as transgender in middle school, his mother, Heather, jumped into research mode."

Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"Sesame becomes a “major allergen,” joining milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans. If you have a food allergy, or your child does, chances are you spend a lot of time reading labels to figure out whether something will trigger an allergic reaction."

Idaho,2021.0,Q2,"Hoping for a return to normal, more than 400 colleges and universities are requiring students to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Almost all are in states that voted for President Biden. For more than 400 colleges and universities, it is being billed as the ticket to a normal year on campus: Require all students to be vaccinated for the coronavirus before they can matriculate next fall."
Idaho,2021.0,Q3,"Who needs a booster shot? Do Americans need coronavirus vaccine boosters, and if so, when?"
Idaho,2021.0,Q3,"Does Moderna or Pfizer have the edge? In the early days of the vaccine rollout in the U.S., Pfizer somehow became the “status vaccine” — the subject of memes and funny jokes about the “hot people” in the “Pfizer Gang.”"
Idaho,2021.0,Q3,"“Our state literally shrunk in 2020,” said Dr. Scott Harris, the state’s health officer. For the first time in Alabama’s known history, the state had more deaths than births in 2020 — a grim milestone that underscores the pandemic’s calamitous toll."
Idaho,2021.0,Q3,"Administrators face “a delicate balancing act” in a state where hospitals are crowded, workers are scarce and vaccine resistance is widespread. The coronavirus is raging in the northern states of the Mountain West, especially Wyoming, where the Delta variant is tearing through one of the least vaccinated areas in the country."

Idaho,2021.0,Q3,"The U.S. pandemic outlook. Even if you’ve been following news of the virus closely, it can be hard to know which way the pandemic is headed. To help sort it out, I gathered a few charts that give us a clearer picture."
Idaho,2021.0,Q3,"Vaccine uptake has risen from early-summer lows all over the United States, and the upswing is especially pronounced in places that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic’s fourth wave.

Idaho,2021.0,Q4,"President Biden has said the government should help people who continue to experience symptoms long after a coronavirus infection. But qualifying remains a major hurdle. Since she tested positive for the coronavirus in April 2020, Josie Cabrera Taveras has found herself sleeping for up to 15 hours a day, stopping in grocery store aisles to catch her breath, lapsing in and out of consciousness and unable to return to her job as a nanny."
Idaho,2021.0,Q4,"Since vaccines became widely available in April, nearly 250,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States. Their demographics are different from earlier in the pandemic.

Idaho,2021.0,Q4,"Researchers have been studying how much care American adults will require as they age, and for how long. Say you’re a 65-year-old looking ahead, wondering about your health and your finances, pondering what life might be like in 20 years."
Idaho,2021.0,Q4,"The committee is chaired by Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who ripped President Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which on Wednesday considered some high-profile diplomatic nominations, has often been a decorous debating society, but Rahm Emanuel and R. Nicholas Burns, President Biden’s picks for ambassadorial posts in Japan and China faced a wilder ride."

Idaho,2021.0,Q4,"As doctors and patients worry about the effects of painkillers, therapists are finding they can be a powerful salve for suffering. Over the past two decades, as the opioid crisis has shaken the public’s view of painkillers and pharmaceutical companies have come under fire for their marketing practices, many patients are looking for alternatives. One of the leading contenders has become treating pain with talk therapy."

Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"For the past 10 years, wolves have been steadily returning to the state after being wiped out a century ago. But not everyone is rolling out the welcome mat. Kent Laudon, a wolf biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, woke up one morning last year to a flurry of text messages from a rancher in the state’s northernmost county. He was asking about a post with wildly specific details spreading across Facebook that urged people to find a red truck that was transporting breeding wolves along Route 97 into Siskiyou County, Calif. Mr. Laudon was not surprised. This wasn’t the first post of its kind, and it wouldn’t be the last."

Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"The annual March for Life rally is taking on a celebratory tone this year as participants expect the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Anti-abortion protesters descended on Washington from across the country on Friday for the annual March for Life, a ritual that this year took on a tone of hopeful celebration as they anticipated the Supreme Court overturning the decision that established a constitutional right to abortion half a century ago."
Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"What happens in the state rarely stays there. For half a year, Roe v. Wade — the 1973 Supreme Court decision that guarantees abortion rights for all Americans — has been effectively moot in the second largest state in the country, home to about 10 percent of the nation’s reproductive-age women."
Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"Alex Hall and Nick Goepper crowd the podium in the freeski event. Teammate Colby Stevenson was hoping to make a sweep with bronze, but came in seventh. Alex Hall let out a whoop when he landed his last trick on the slopestyle course, and that was before the judges awarded him with what would be the winning score. It was, he said later, the best run of his life."
Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"In anticipation of the court’s decision, a frenzy of legislative activity to shut down access to abortion forms a picture of a post-Roe America. Both sides of the abortion debate anticipate that come July, the Supreme Court will have overturned Roe v. Wade and with it the constitutional right to abortion, handing anti-abortion activists a victory they have sought for five decades. But from Florida to Idaho, Republican-led state legislatures are not waiting: They are operating as if Roe has already been struck down, advancing new restrictions that aim to make abortion illegal in as many circumstances as possible."
Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"We’re still finding out how much learning loss children experienced. When I think of the parents I’ve interviewed in the past two years, some of the most affected in the early days of the pandemic were those whose children have learning disabilities or differences. Remote school was hard for everyone, but it was particularly difficult for families whose children — 14 percent of all American public school students — needed additional support to learn."
Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"In Spokane, Wash., home prices jumped 60 percent in the past two years. The increase is fueled by buyers fleeing the boom in cities like Austin. Who will have to flee next? Maybe it was the date night when he and his wife spent two hours driving 19 miles to dinner, or the homeless encampment down the street, or the fact that homes were so expensive that his children could never afford to live near him."
Idaho,2022.0,Q1,"Fully enforcing abortion bans could mean going after women. With Roe v. Wade on thin ice, state legislatures are producing a wave of anti-abortion bills, some of them truly eye-popping. Missouri alone has in recent weeks tried to limit out-of-state travel for abortion, proposed treating the delivery or shipment of abortion pills as drug trafficking and moved to make it a felony to perform an abortion in the event of an ectopic pregnancy (in which a fertilized egg implants outside the womb), a condition that can be life-threatening."
Idaho,2022.0,Q2,Women can no longer get a legal abortion in two states. Follow our live updates on the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Idaho,2022.0,Q2,"A federal judge promised to rule by May 23 on the public health measure, known as Title 42, that has barred migrants from requesting asylum. LAFAYETTE, La. — Lawyers for 24 states critical of the Biden administration’s immigration policies argued on Friday for a nationwide injunction to maintain the swift expulsions of migrants under a pandemic-related public policy, and a federal judge said he planned to issue an order before the policy is set to be rescinded on May 23."
Idaho,2022.0,Q2,"The measure is part of a wave of stringent abortion restrictions enacted by legislators in Republican-led states. Lawmakers in Oklahoma on Tuesday approved a near-total ban on abortion, making it the latest Republican-led state to forge ahead with stringent abortion legislation as the Supreme Court weighs a case that could overturn Roe v. Wade later this year."

Idaho,2022.0,Q2,"The mask rule on planes and public transportation has been targeted by the travel industry and Republican lawmakers. In the end, it was brought down by a little-known nonprofit, a conservative judge and chance. When the federal mandate requiring masks to be worn on planes and other public transportation crumbled last week, it was not because of lobbying by established trade organizations, or the strident calls of Republican lawmakers, or even a determination by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that masks were no longer necessary."
Idaho,2022.0,Q2,"Nationwide, the number of kindergartners with the required shots fell below the target for broad immunity, raising fears of outbreaks of measles and other illnesses. Kindergartners in the United States fell behind on routine childhood vaccinations during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday, a slide that experts attributed to skipped checkups and to a groundswell of resistance to Covid-19 shots spilling into unease about other vaccines."
Idaho,2022.0,Q2,"A federal judge temporarily halted part of a new law that prevents doctors from prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapies to transgender youth. He upheld a ban on sex-altering operations. A federal judge late Friday blocked portions of an Alabama law that prevent medical professionals from providing care that helps transgender children and teenagers transition, making it a felony offense that is punishable by up to 10 years in prison."
Idaho,2022.0,Q2,"Abortion rights advocates filed lawsuits to halt or delay bans on abortion in some states, with judges in Louisiana and Utah temporarily blocking new laws. SACRAMENTO — The battle over abortion shifted to the states on Monday as a weekend of furious protest and prayerful thanksgiving in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade reversal gave way to a coast-to-coast wave of lawsuits, legislation and pitched political fights. "

Idaho,2022.0,Q2,"An absolute abortion ban that Texas wrote before Roe v. Wade is on hold while a long-ago ban in Wisconsin reaches the courts. A previously blocked six-week ban in Tennessee has taken effect. A state-by-state legal battle in the wake of the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling widened on Tuesday as a judge in Texas temporarily blocked a statewide abortion ban, a federal court let Tennessee tighten existing restrictions, Iowa Republicans said they would ask courts to clear the way for a ban from the moment fetal cardiac activity could be detected, and Wisconsin Democrats announced they were filing suit to halt the resurrection of abortion laws dating to the 19th century."
Idaho,2022.0,Q3,"State abortion bans carry narrow but sometimes vague exceptions, and years of prison time. That’s forcing doctors to think like lawyers, and hospitals to create new protocols. In Wisconsin, a group of doctors and lawyers is trying to come up with guidelines on how to comply with a newly revived 173-year-old law that prohibits abortion except to save the life of a pregnant woman. They face the daunting task of defining all the emergencies and conditions that might result in a pregnant woman’s death, and the fact that doctors could be punished with six years in prison if a prosecutor disagrees that abortion was necessary."
Idaho,2022.0,Q3,"Concerned about losing access to pregnancy care, and fearful of legal consequences, surrogates and those who work with them are rewriting contracts and changing the way they operate. During her 20-week pregnancy ultrasound last month, a woman living near the Utah-Idaho border learned she had a major rupture in her amniotic sac. The 27-year-old is a gestational surrogate, which means the fetus she was carrying was for someone else — in this case, a man who lives abroad. The fetus, she was told, was unlikely to survive, and her own health was at risk if she continued the pregnancy."

Idaho,2022.0,Q3,Take roof trusses. Many of us are intrigued by wonders that scream “THE FUTURE” like flying cars. But sometimes the best inventions are more about brain power than technology magic. Let me give you a couple of examples in my quest to appreciate the ingenuity in boring things.

Idaho,2022.0,Q3,"In the America where I came of age, I was told my life was worth more than my ability to have babies. And my sexuality was nothing to be ashamed of. One day I hope to become a mother. But for now, I have sex just because I like it. Sex is fun."

Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"The tentative agreement, brokered in September with help from the Biden administration, had averted a strike before the midterm elections. Members of a union that primarily represents freight rail conductors have narrowly voted down a tentative labor contract, their union said Monday."
Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"Armed Americans, often pushing a right-wing agenda, are increasingly using open-carry laws to intimidate opponents and shut down debate. Across the country, openly carrying a gun in public is no longer just an exercise in self-defense — increasingly it is a soapbox for elevating one’s voice and, just as often, quieting someone else’s."
Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"A tentative new contract brokered by the White House offered employees one day off, leaving some dissatisfied and raising the risk of another impasse. A dozen men stood in a parking lot outside a dilapidated motel in rural Texas, sharing a fish dinner cooked in a portable fryer. They had spent the previous 12 hours under a pounding sun, repairing track for a major American railroad."
Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"For Trump, Pelosi, Biden and Musk, not everything is going according to plan. Gail Collins: Bret, before we get to politics, let’s talk about the terrible shooting at the gay club in Colorado Springs on Saturday night. To me, it speaks to both gay rights and gun violence. We’ve been making certain progress on the first, not really on the second. And if you want to tie in the mass shooting at the University of Virginia and the terrible stabbings in Idaho — Lord, what do you say?"
Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"The Clean Water Act, now 50, led to the cleanup of many filthy waterways. Its work is far from done. In the early 1830s, the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville, on his way to the Great Lakes, is said to have described the waters around Cleveland as among the clearest he had ever seen. Less than four decades later, in 1868, a river he had greatly admired, the Cuyahoga, by then choked with industrial and municipal waste, burst into flames. It would do this periodically until 1969, when one last blaze persuaded the editors of Time magazine’s new “environment” section to publish pictures of the Cuyahoga on fire. “Some river!” Time exclaimed. “Chocolate brown, oily, bubbling with subsurface gases, it oozes rather than flows.”"
Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"Political violence from right-wing extremists is a growing problem in America. What can we do about it? Over the past five years, incidents of political violence in the United States by right-wing extremists have soared. Few experts who track this type of violence believe things will get better anytime soon without concerted action. Domestic extremism is actually likely to worsen. The attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of the speaker of the House of Representatives, was only the latest episode, and federal officials warn that the threat of violence could continue to escalate after the midterm elections."
Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"Republicans are trying to limit the use of citizen-initiated legislation in some states after years of progressive victories. Ballot measures, a tool many states adopted during the Progressive Era to allow voters to pass their own laws, don’t always get much news coverage — but they can often surprise us."
Idaho,2022.0,Q4,"He’s expected to announce his third White House run at a time when he is politically vulnerable. There will be no golden escalator this time, but neither will there be mocking guffaws or can-you-believe-this eye-rolling. As Donald Trump is expected to kick off another presidential campaign tonight, the world has changed rather drastically since his first. Whatever else is thought of his attempted comeback, it will not be dismissed as an implausible joke."

For the first time since the fight over abortion access was kicked to the states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, newly elected legislatures around the country are coming into session and are putting the polarizing issue at the top of their agendas. Around 300 bills in 40 states have been proposed so far — with a majority seeking to restrict access to abortion, and others trying to strengthen it."

The Florida Legislature passed a bill on Thursday that would prohibit gender-transition care for minors and restrict it for adults, one of several measures aimed at L.G.B.T.Q. communities that have been passed during this year’s legislative session. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican crisscrossing the country as he tests a possible 2024 presidential run, is expected to sign it into law."
Idaho,2023.0,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Idaho,2023.0,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors.

Idaho,2023.0,Q2,"The court split 3-3 on whether to revive a much stricter six-week limit, enacted in 2018, that was struck down before Roe v. Wade was overturned. A legal attempt to ban abortion in Iowa after six weeks of pregnancy failed on Friday, after the State Supreme Court deadlocked over whether to vacate a lower court’s injunction and allow the ban to take effect. That means abortion will remain legal in Iowa through 20 weeks of pregnancy."

But I quickly began to realize that her ordeal could not possibly be unusual and then to fear that our current health care system is becoming more unfriendly, inhospitable to patients and to nurses as well."

Back in 2002, when the SARS virus made its fateful leap from bats to civet cats to humans, global health experts warned that the ensuing outbreak was a harbinger of things to come: Climate change and globalization were conspiring with an array of other forces to make it much easier for old animal diseases to morph into new human ones.

Indiana,2021.0,Q3,"A tiny number of doctors have had an outsize influence in spreading false information about Covid-19 and vaccines. Standing before a local school board in central Indiana this month, Dr. Daniel Stock, a physician in the state, issued a litany of false claims about the coronavirus.

Indiana,2021.0,Q3,What we learn is filtered through our identities. I got in a bit of a dust-up online recently for concluding that vaccine hesitance and resistance to masking were not uncommon among health care workers — and that it wasn’t surprising. I based my conclusion on vaccine hesitancy on some personal experience — a nurse at my vaccine site was very vocal about refusing the vaccine — and on various surveys showing that not all health care workers are willing to get vaccinated.

Indiana,2021.0,Q4,"The decision will broaden access to medication abortion, an increasingly common method, but many conservative states are already mobilizing against it.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, a mother I interviewed as part of my study on pandemic parenting said, she never had a problem with vaccines.

The Chicago Bulls’ next two games — against the Detroit Pistons and Toronto Raptors — have been postponed because 10 Bulls players, as well as other staff members, are in the league’s Covid-19 health and safety protocols, the N.B.A. announced Monday.

Indiana,2022.0,Q1,"The erosion of reproductive rights is a result of raw, bare-knuckled politics, as a minority exercises its power over a majority. This could well be the last anniversary of Roe. Ever since the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to abortion through that decision, 49 years ago on Saturday, Republicans have been chipping away at reproductive rights. Now, the court is poised to overturn the decision once and for all — fulfilling a longstanding dream not just of fringe elements of the Republican Party, but also of its leadership.

Indiana,2022.0,Q1,"With visual cues and complex steps, at-home coronavirus tests are often inaccessible to blind people. But some low- and high-tech workarounds could help. Christy Smith has never been tested for the coronavirus. As a blind person, she can’t drive to testing sites near her home in St. Louis, and they are too far away for her to walk. Alternative options — public transportation, ride share apps or having a friend drive her to a test site — would put others at risk for exposure."
Indiana,2022.0,Q1,"Hold off before freaking out about that new C.D.C. diabetes study. I got a lot of feedback on my last newsletter, about how parents of children under 5 are struggling in a variety of ways with the pandemic’s current Omicron wave.

In May 1972, the Chicago police raided a high-rise apartment where a group called the Jane Collective was providing abortions. It was the year before the Supreme Court’s Roe v.

Indiana,2022.0,Q2,"Why haven’t we solved the addiction crisis? For most of his life, Harris Marquesano struggled to live inside his own skin. He was a sweet boy — affectionate with his parents, protective of his little sister and devoted to his friends. But he had more energy than he knew what to do with, and he worried almost constantly. In preschool, when his teacher had to have surgery, he was so distressed by her absence that he tried to take over his classroom, presiding over each playgroup like a tiny, anxious general. By junior high, he was acting out in earnest. Some of Harris’s teachers suggested to his mother, Stephanie Marquesano, that he was just testing limits. But she knew it was more than that. “He was crawling out of his own skin half the time,” she said. “Running around and acting out was the only way for him to manage that feeling.”"

I had purchased the RoundTrip Choice plan from Seven Corners Travel Insurance, so I called, expecting they would help coordinate my medical care with Italian-speaking doctors. But they told me to seek help on my own, save the receipts and file a claim when I got home. Our tour guide was an angel, arranging drivers to take me back and forth to the hospital and even interpreting by speakerphone with doctors. Days later I got a doctor to fill out a form (which I had to Google Translate for him) saying I could travel home, as long as I was in a reclining position. My family chipped in to buy a business-class seat for the return flight, a day-and-night trip from Palermo to Munich to New York to Jacksonville. Seven Corners finally paid $5,772 for my bills and missed trip, but refused to reimburse me for most of my business-class fare. Far worse, I believe they failed to provide me the assistance they promised, essentially leaving me to fend for myself and leaving me unable to communicate with hospital staff.

She is 97, diagnosed with moderate dementia and is considered high risk to be left home alone. We had been applying for Medicaid long-term care to receive a home health aide since early November 2021. She finally got a home health aide in January 2022, but it’s been a nightmare. They are so desperate to hire workers that they will take anyone. She was left without an aide on many random days with a late-notice telephone call or text message from the aide needing the day off and the agencies not able to find a replacement in time. I have changed agencies multiple times. My husband has been a great support the entire time. We rely on security cameras we installed in our apartment to see how she is doing while we are at work. How is it on a daily basis? It is emotionally and physically draining. The health care system for the elderly is neglected, broken and inadequate to meet any demands, even the basic needs."

Kentucky,2020.0,Q1,"Medicaid expansion is just the latest example of how liberal policies make for good politics. When left-wing Democrats push for universal benefits and expansive new policies, they do so with a theory of politics in mind. It goes like this: The reason to fight for debt-free college or Medicare for all isn’t just to improve life for Americans, but to build new ground for progressive political activity. New programs create new constituencies, and new programs with broad benefits can give more Americans a stake in the expansion and preservation of the welfare state. Conservatives know this. That’s why they’ve fought so hard to block or undermine even modest new programs."

Kentucky,2023.0,Q4,"Democratic candidates jumped on the story of a woman who left Texas for an abortion as a cautionary tale for voters, and Republicans were largely silent. The case of a Texas woman who sought a court-approved abortion but wound up leaving the state for the procedure is reigniting political arguments that have roiled elections for more than two years, placing Democrats on the offensive and illustrating Republicans’ continued lack of a unified policy response or clear strategy on how to talk about the issue."
Kentucky,2023.0,Q4,"Despite his bad poll numbers, I see a path to victory for Biden. Well, this week has been an emotional roller coaster. On Sunday, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed President Biden behind Donald Trump in a bunch of battleground states, sending Democrats into a tizzy.

Louisiana,2020.0,Q1,The most sophisticated opponents of abortion have long been playing a much subtler game — and we’re about to see it come to fruition. What if the heartbeat bills — those bans on abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy that made headlines last spring in states from Georgia to Missouri — were not the real story?

Louisiana,2020.0,Q1,"For immigrants languishing behind bars, a hunger strike is often the sole remaining means of protest against a dehumanizing and unjust system. On Jan. 29, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported to India an asylum-seeker who had spent nearly eight months in ICE detention. He was one of five asylum-seekers of South Asian origin who went on a hunger strike in October at the LaSalle Detention Center, an ICE processing facility in Jena, La, operated by the for-profit prison company GEO Group. All five had exercised their legal right to claim asylum, after escaping religious or political persecution."
Louisiana,2020.0,Q1,"Medicaid expansion is just the latest example of how liberal policies make for good politics. When left-wing Democrats push for universal benefits and expansive new policies, they do so with a theory of politics in mind. It goes like this: The reason to fight for debt-free college or Medicare for all isn’t just to improve life for Americans, but to build new ground for progressive political activity. New programs create new constituencies, and new programs with broad benefits can give more Americans a stake in the expansion and preservation of the welfare state. Conservatives know this. That’s why they’ve fought so hard to block or undermine even modest new programs."

Louisiana,2020.0,Q2,"For the Zulu club, a black social organization in New Orleans, Mardi Gras was a joy. The coronavirus made it a tragedy. When the Krewe of Zulu parade rolled out onto Jackson Avenue to kick off Mardi Gras festivities on Feb. 25, the party started for black New Orleans. Tens of thousands of people lined the four-and-a-half-mile route, reveling in the animated succession of jazz musicians, high-stepping marching bands from historically black colleges and universities and loose-limbed dancers dressed in Zulu costumes, complete with grass skirts and blackface makeup, an homage to the Zulu people of South Africa and, for some, a satirical spit in the eye to the past, when Mardi Gras was put on by clubs of white men who barred black people from taking part."

If the recent rout in the stock market has you drastically cutting back your retirement spending plans, it probably means that you were counting too much on ever-rising asset prices.

When Nancy Davis of Baton Rouge, La., learned last summer that the fetus she was carrying had a rare and fatal condition, her anguish was compounded by the chaotic legal terrain surrounding the abortion ban in her state.

Maine,2022.0,Q3,"In “Lucy by the Sea,” Elizabeth Strout relocates a formerly married couple from Manhattan to Maine at the peak of the Covid pandemic. When global events erupt like earthquakes, writers rush to record the aftershocks. In the 21st century, we’ve already seen waves of reportage and fiction in the aftermaths of 9/11, tsunamis, Brexit and Trumpism. Now the literature of Covid has landed, pretty much on schedule, informed by the sensibilities of the well-off. As recounted in their respective books, “Last Best Hope” and “Intimations,” George Packer and Zadie Smith had the means to flee New York when the city locked down in March 2020. So did Gary Shteyngart, whose novel, “Our Country Friends,” chronicles members of the chattering classes displaced to a bungalow colony, away from the ceaseless sirens and spiking fatalities. (A New York Times article featured a photograph of a quarantined Shteyngart, cocktail in hand, at his second house in Dutchess County, where he’d decamped.)"

Maine,2022.0,Q3,"Women have become refugees fleeing their home states for reproductive health care that a month ago was theirs by right. My own way of keeping track of a Supreme Court term is to log each of the term’s decisions on a chart labeled by category: criminal law, administrative law, speech, federalism and so on. For this past term, one of my charts was, of course, labeled “abortion,” and naturally that’s where I recorded Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade."

But your cat may be listening after all. More than that, it cares more than you may think."
Maine,2022.0,Q4,"Caring for kids and parents simultaneously can carry an emotional and financial toll. In early 2020, I wrote about the struggles of the “sandwich generation,” demographers’ label for those who are caring for children and aging relatives at the same time. The sandwich generation parents I spoke to in that prepandemic moment talked about the emotional and financial toll of that level of caregiving responsibility. Some had to leave full-time employment or change jobs because caring for a parent with failing health and children with their own abundant needs took too much time and required too much flexibility."

Maine,2022.0,Q4,"Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times. I was a French major in college, not an English major, and so I spent a lot of my early 20s catching up on the kind of classics that my friends had read in school: Austen, Dickens, Hemingway, Ellison. There’s a certain unhindered joy in reading for yourself instead of for a syllabus, but there’s also the considerable drawback — heightened in those pre-internet days — that you don’t have a professor standing by to explain the tricky bits to you. So while I cherish my memories of reading “The Waste Land” on city buses and park benches in 1990s San Francisco, I knew even while I was reading it that the main thing I would come away with was a feel for its rhythm and mood while galloping right over the context of Eliot’s life and times that might have cracked it wider open for me."
Maine,2022.0,Q4,"The Clean Water Act, now 50, led to the cleanup of many filthy waterways. Its work is far from done. In the early 1830s, the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville, on his way to the Great Lakes, is said to have described the waters around Cleveland as among the clearest he had ever seen. Less than four decades later, in 1868, a river he had greatly admired, the Cuyahoga, by then choked with industrial and municipal waste, burst into flames. It would do this periodically until 1969, when one last blaze persuaded the editors of Time magazine’s new “environment” section to publish pictures of the Cuyahoga on fire. “Some river!” Time exclaimed. “Chocolate brown, oily, bubbling with subsurface gases, it oozes rather than flows.”"

Maine,2023.0,Q1,"Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind.

Maine,2023.0,Q2,"In Justin Cronin’s novel “The Ferryman,” residents of  enjoy respectable, cultured lives — until their memories are wiped. For a science-fictional utopia created by a reclusive “Designer,” the world of “The Ferryman” bears a startling resemblance to the well-heeled strata of, say, San Francisco or New York. People fetch soy lattes after yoga, “flushed with high-minded health.” They live in self-designed houses overlooking the sea, hold season tickets to the opera, have careers as couturiers and art dealers and vintners."
Maine,2023.0,Q2,President Lincoln and Republicans in Congress recognized that preserving America’s credit was the key to financing the Civil War and therefore to the government’s survival. The looming American debt crisis is politically contrived. The Treasury could borrow all it needed if the Republican majority in the House acted responsibly and raised the debt ceiling.

He wasn’t very political — he didn’t vote in 2020, he said, because he thought Donald Trump was a “psycho” and Joe Biden was “corrupt.” It wasn’t until the pandemic that Whitney started regularly watching the news, but as he did, he felt that things weren’t adding up. He doubted what he called “the narrative” and struggled with the hostility his questions about vaccines and other mitigations elicited from those close to him. He described being “blamed and labeled as someone who’s part of the problem because you’re questioning. Like not taking a stance on it, but just questioning. That was the worst.”"
