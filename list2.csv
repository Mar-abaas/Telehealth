Georgia,Q1,"Republicans in Congress are seeking to capitalize on discontent about the federal coronavirus response while the party’s presidential contenders are vying to be the biggest foe of restrictions.

Georgia,Q1,"The House debated for hours on Tuesday before voting for measures that would end a public health emergency and a vaccine mandate for some health care workers.

Georgia,Q1,"Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has become a star in nine months at Napoli. With his transcendent talent, things may only get better. NAPLES, Italy — European soccer’s breakout star looks briefly uneasy. It is not the setting. That is just about perfect: He is leaning on a wrought-iron railing on the terrace of the Grand Hotel Parker’s, all cut-glass, belle epoque elegance, the city of Naples spilling out to the sea beneath him. At his back lurks Mount Vesuvius, wreathed in clouds."

Georgia,Q1,"‘Should I get rid of my gas stove’ isn’t the only question to ask. It may not even be the right one. My grandmother in India cooked for many years with coal, then with a tank of liquid petroleum gas. As a child in California, I lived in an apartment with an electric stove, then in a house with a gas connection. In London, last summer, I stayed in an apartment with an induction stove that glowed red in an instant. In Kenya a few years before that, I spent hours talking to women cooking dinner in smoky kitchens, over charcoal."
Georgia,Q1,"Corrections that appeared in print on Sunday, Feb. 5, 2023. An article on Page 11 this weekend about the video series “Inside Story” misstates the name of a recurring segment in the series. It is “In the Spotlight,” not “Inside the Spotlight.” Relying on incorrect information from sources involved with the series, it also misidentifies where the series will be streaming. It is the Vice News channel on the streaming platform Plex, not the Vice channel on Tubi."
Georgia,Q1,"In advance of a hearing on Wednesday expected to focus on the lab leak theory, House Republicans took aim at Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, whom they have long vowed to investigate. WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Wednesday will dig into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic in a hearing that promises to be filled with political theater alongside substantive questions about laboratory safety and what, if anything, could have been done to prevent the worst public health crisis in a century."
Georgia,Q1,"I’m afraid pregnant women will die if we don’t change Tennessee’s abortion law. Before the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, I did not consider myself an abortion provider. Ninety-five percent of my work as a high-risk obstetrician was helping women through complex pregnancies to achieve healthy outcomes for both them and their babies."
Georgia,Q1,"Jimmy Carter was probably the most intelligent, hard-working and decent man to have occupied the Oval Office in the 20th century. The man was not what you think. He was tough.

Georgia,Q1,"Activists are pushing for tougher abortion restrictions, while politicians fear turning off swing voters who don’t support strict limits like a national ban. For decades, opposition to abortion was a crucial but relatively clear-cut litmus test for Republican candidates: support overturning a constitutional right to an abortion, back anti-abortion judges and vote against taxpayer funding for the procedure."
Georgia,Q1,"An 86-year-old author has a few rules to live by even when the trials of getting older make it easy to complain. A new book came across my desk recently, with an irresistible title: “The Swedish Art of Aging Exuberantly: Life Wisdom from Someone Who Will (Probably) Die Before You.” I was already familiar with the astringent humor of the author, Margareta Magnusson, having read her previous book, “The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning” — a surprise international best seller and a call to, as she put it, “not leave a mountain of crap behind for our loved ones to clean up after we die.”"
Georgia,Q1,"An activist leader in Atlanta, in 1960 she wrote, with Julian Bond’s help, “An Appeal for Human Rights,” which resonated in the struggle across the country. Roslyn Pope, who as a senior at Spelman College in Atlanta wrote a 1960 manifesto that set the stage for dramatic advances in civil rights in the city and inspired generations of activists around the country, died on Jan. 19 in Arlington, Texas. She was 84."
Georgia,Q1,"The problem of democracy and American law enforcement goes beyond questions of accountability. Earlier this week, I wrote that American policing lies largely outside of democratic control. In practice, despite the formal authority of mayors, city councilors and other elected officials, police departments can and do operate without meaningful accountability or public oversight."
Georgia,Q1,"The CNN correspondent was traveling for work during construction of his family’s house, leaving the decision-making to his wife. (Yes, they’re still married.) The overwrought and the over-scheduled may be cheered to learn that Sanjay Gupta speaks quite highly of stress."
Georgia,Q1,"Studying the venom of bees, wasps and ants, he was stung hundreds of times and famously ranked the stings in a colorful pain scale index. Justin O. Schmidt, an intrepid entomologist who measured the agony of insect stings by allowing himself to be stung hundreds of times in creating a renowned and vividly descriptive pain scale that ranked them, died on Feb. 18 in Tucson, Ariz. He was 75."

Georgia,Q1,"Living Carbon, a biotechnology company, hopes its seedlings can help manage climate change. But wider use of its trees may be elusive. On Monday, in a low-lying tract of southern Georgia’s pine belt, a half-dozen workers planted row upon row of twig-like poplar trees."
Georgia,Q1,"Last year’s democratic wins could have big implications. Imagine if the U.S. and its allies had reacted less aggressively to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Without Western weapons to bolster its defenses, Ukraine could have fallen. Without Western sanctions, Russia might have felt little economic pressure. Such inaction would have sent a message: Western powers won’t stand up for other democracies."
Georgia,Q1,"Five articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."

Georgia,Q1,"The 1619 Project, which has been adapted into a podcast and a book, premieres as a documentary on Hulu this week. In 2019, to mark the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved people arriving in the United States, The New York Times Magazine published The 1619 Project. It was the beginning of an ongoing long-form journalism initiative, created by Nikole Hannah-Jones, that reframes the history of slavery in America and explores how it touches nearly every aspect of modern life. The 1619 Project has been used as a curriculum in some 4,500 classrooms; it has also been adapted into a podcast and a best-selling book that features essays by contributors about slavery’s legacy. And on Thursday, it finally makes its way to the screen in the form of a six-part documentary series on Hulu."
Georgia,Q1,"And quick. Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. I know you’re keen to handicap — figuratively, but maybe also literally — the emerging field of Republican presidential hopefuls. First Donald Trump, now Nikki Haley and soon, possibly, a fellow Palmetto State Republican, Senator Tim Scott. That’s on top of probable runs by Ron DeSantis, Mike Pompeo and Mike Pence and possibly Brian Kemp of Georgia, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Chris Christie of … New Jersey."
Georgia,Q1,"Just like exercise, or sleep, relationships require maintenance, too. We have reached the seventh and final day of the Happiness Challenge! Congratulations on your efforts to take care of your emotional, psychological, and physical health by building and strengthening your connections. You’ve assessed your social universe, made an eight-minute phone call (or two), chatted up someone you didn’t know, expressed your thanks, reached out to people at work, and put plans on the calendar. (If you missed a day, that’s OK. You can find the previous installments here, then do them at your own pace.)"

Georgia,Q1,"“Granny flats” are popping up in backyards across the country, affording Americans a new housing option. Some communities are not happy about it. Forty-five years ago, Betty Szudy and her wife, Maggie Roth, both 70, bought a Craftsman bungalow in Oakland, Calif. In 2017, at the same time their son and his wife were fruitlessly searching for an affordable apartment in the neighborhood, California was liberalizing its housing laws to encourage so-called accessory dwelling units, or A.D.U.s."
Georgia,Q1,"Most joint manipulations aren’t dangerous, but one rare complication can result in serious injury. Going to a chiropractor has become an accepted part of medical care, with about 15 percent of adults in the United States visiting one every year. Although critics claim the field lacks scientific validity, chiropractic treatments provide many people with pain relief, and a vast majority take place without incident."
Georgia,Q1,"A train with over 300 passengers on board collided with a freight train. The prime minister blamed “tragic human error,” the police arrested a station manager, and the transport minister announced his resignation. Rescue workers in Greece frantically searched for survivors through flattened carriages and smoking wreckage on Wednesday after a high-speed, head-on collision between a freight train and a passenger train killed at least 38 people and injured scores of others in what appeared to be the country’s deadliest rail accident."
Georgia,Q1,A presidency that’s been short on galvanizing TV gets an infusion of energy from a feisty speech. It’s a rare speech where you go onstage hoping to get booed.
Georgia,Q1,"The annual march, which was started in 2017 as a reaction to the election of President Donald J. Trump, this year focused on abortion rights. With signs declaring “Abortion Is Health Care” and chants about fighting back, activists in dozens of cities nationwide rallied in support of abortion rights on Sunday, the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that was overturned by the Supreme Court, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion."
Georgia,Q1,"President Biden in Warsaw. President Biden wrapped up a three-day trip to Europe yesterday with a promise of America’s commitment to its allies. He met in Warsaw with leaders from NATO’s eastern flank, reminding them that they know “what’s at stake in this conflict, not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world.”"
Georgia,Q1,"“Trust the Plan,” by Will Sommer, tracks the emergence of a bizarre movement from the wastewaters of the internet. It all started, in a way, with Hunter S. Thompson. In “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” (1971), his gonzo-psychedelic classic, Thompson described ingesting a rare and illicit drug called adrenochrome. You could obtain it only from the adrenaline glands of a living human body."
Georgia,Q1,"The National Restaurant Association uses mandatory $15 food-safety classes to turn waiters and cooks into unwitting funders of its battle against minimum wage increases.

Georgia,Q1,"Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois has maintained his political organization, built a progressive record and is open about his ambitions. For now, he says, they don’t include the White House.

Pritzker of Illinois sat comfortably in an office board room high above the Loop on Monday and halfheartedly batted away the notion that he was preparing a run for the White House."
Georgia,Q1,"G.O.P. elites are simply lagging their states. My whole adult life, the work of fighting climate change was understood as the job of the blue team in America. The red team, we knew, just wasn’t going to play ball."
Georgia,Q1,"Wild animals eat the strangest things. That can be a problem, for them and for us. In September 1985, the authorities discovered the body of Andrew Thornton, a drug smuggler, in a Tennessee backyard. He had a bag full of cocaine, a failed parachute and the key to a small airplane, which turned up at a crash site about 60 miles away."
Georgia,Q1,"The House, back in Republican hands, is invoking its powers to weigh in on D.C. legislation, including an overhaul of the city’s century-old criminal code.

Georgia,Q1,"Both U.S. political parties are now open to the idea that Covid may have come from a lab in China. A new House committee investigating the origins of Covid opened its first public hearing yesterday with plenty of political theater.

But lawmakers displayed bipartisan agreement on one point: The virus really may have come from a laboratory in China."
Georgia,Q1,"Develop stronger relationships in 2023. For over 80 years, researchers at Harvard have studied what makes for a good life. They found one surefire, scientifically proven predictor of happiness: developing warmer relationships."
Georgia,Q1,"The repeated outbursts that interrupted the State of the Union address encapsulated the ethos of the new Republican majority, which styles itself after former President Donald J. Trump. WASHINGTON — The House floor has been no stranger to rowdy spectacle in 2023, but the eruptions of Republican vitriol against President Biden during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night underscored a new and notably coarse normal in Congress, where members of the G.O.P. majority tossed aside rules of decorum and turned the annual speech into a showcase for partisan hostility."

Georgia,Q2,Large health insurers and other companies are especially keen on doctors’ groups that care for patients in private Medicare plans. It’s no surprise that the shortage of primary care doctors — who are critically important to the health of Americans — is getting worse.
Georgia,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."

Georgia,Q2,"Public health experts have sounded alarms over the potential risks. But if you’ve already given your child full access, here’s how to cut back. Jason Mahr’s eldest son was 13 years old when Mr. Mahr and his wife gave him access to social media, a decision the 44-year-old father of five regretted immediately."
Georgia,Q2,"A new executive order requires every federal agency to address the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate change on minority communities. WASHINGTON — President Biden on Friday announced the creation of a White House Office of Environmental Justice, one of several actions to address the unequal burden that people of color carry from environmental hazards."
Georgia,Q2,"The conservative state legislatures couldn’t muster enough votes to pass bills that would have severely restricted the procedure. South Carolina and Nebraska, two conservative states that have been pushing to ban abortion, on Thursday both failed to pass new bills prohibiting the procedure, preserving wide access to abortion in those states and handing surprise victories to abortion rights advocates."
Georgia,Q2,"Regardless of income or education, Black mothers have worse birth outcomes. When Afrika Gupton-Jones was on bed rest in the hospital, after developing high blood pressure at 28 weeks of pregnancy, her husband was with her day and night. Yet the nurses often assumed that he was her brother, and that she was a single mother. When the doctors and nurses gave her medications or took her blood, she said, they gave her minimal explanation."

Georgia,Q2,"Temperatures will be up to 20 degrees above normal for much of the region through at least the weekend, with no nighttime relief. Even for Southerners used to spending a lot of time outside, this week’s brutal heat and humidity — which spread from Texas across the Gulf Coast and north into Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas on Wednesday — are a little much."
Georgia,Q2,"The 86-year-old businessman-turned-politician, now a senator, was admitted to an intensive care unit in Milan. He was said to have a “problem related to a previous infection.” The former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was admitted to intensive care at a hospital in Milan on Wednesday and is expected to remain for a few days, hospital officials said."
Georgia,Q2,"The court split 3-3 on whether to revive a much stricter six-week limit, enacted in 2018, that was struck down before Roe v. Wade was overturned. A legal attempt to ban abortion in Iowa after six weeks of pregnancy failed on Friday, after the State Supreme Court deadlocked over whether to vacate a lower court’s injunction and allow the ban to take effect. That means abortion will remain legal in Iowa through 20 weeks of pregnancy."

Georgia,Q2,"The ad, paid for by the Democratic National Committee, tries to take back the mantle of patriotism often claimed by Republicans, leaning heavily on images of the flag and of the Capitol riot.

Georgia,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors. Ten states in the past three months have passed laws prohibiting what is known as gender-affirming care for young people, in a rapid effort by Republican lawmakers across the country."
Georgia,Q2,"The prohibition is among the most restrictive in the country, and Florida will no longer be a destination for women from across the Deep South seeking the procedure.

Ron DeSantis to transform the state to one of the most restrictive in the country."

Georgia,Q2,"The legislation, which faced a filibuster led by five women senators, now heads to the governor who has said he will sign it. The South Carolina Senate passed a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy on Tuesday, after a filibuster led by five women senators, including three Republicans, failed to block it.

Georgia,Q2,"The Manhattan indictments may not even present his biggest legal threat. Donald Trump is expected to turn himself in to the Manhattan authorities today. Further down, you can read about the latest developments and what to expect today."
Georgia,Q2,"While clinics in some states expanded capacity, bans prevented thousands from getting legal abortions, a major new survey of abortion providers finds. The number of legal abortions in the United States decreased just over 6 percent in the six months after the Supreme Court ended the right to abortion last June, according to a report released Tuesday, the most comprehensive and up-to-date count of abortions nationwide."
Georgia,Q2,"The Treasury Department’s ability to delay a default, the so-called X-date, hinges on how fast the money is coming in.

Georgia,Q2,"Among many unexpected symptoms that crop up during perimenopause, your menstrual cycle can get completely out of whack. In 2016, Alisha Coleman, a 52-year-old 911 call-center worker in Georgia, was fired from her job because she started experiencing a hallmark symptom of perimenopause: unpredictable and heavy periods, also known as flash periods. Once, her period was so heavy, she bled through her clothes and onto an office chair. Another time, she leaked onto the carpet. Those instances, as her employer put it, amounted to a failure to “practice high standards of personal hygiene” while on duty, and were reason for termination."
Georgia,Q2,"Gunfire and shelling still trapped many residents in their homes in the capital, but others took advantage of the truce announcement to flee on the 11th day of fighting. A United States-brokered cease-fire in Sudan appeared to be on shaky ground on Tuesday as gunfire and loud explosions erupted in Khartoum, the capital, threatening continued efforts by thousands of people to flee a conflict that has ripped through Africa’s third-largest nation for more than a week."
Georgia,Q2,Republican lawmakers are putting limits on progressive prosecutors. A fight has erupted in several states between Republican lawmakers and locally elected Democrats over how to respond to crime.
Georgia,Q2,"In return for the shield, the billionaire owners of Purdue Pharma are committed to paying up to $6 billion to help compensate communities and individuals for the ravages of the opioid epidemic. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court granted members of the billionaire Sackler family a legal golden key that they had been seeking for nearly four years: The Sacklers will be shielded from all civil opioid claims related to their company, Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin.

Georgia,Q2,"New research warns that nearly 800,000 residents would need emergency medical care for heat stroke and other illnesses in an extended power failure. Other cities are also at risk.

Georgia,Q2,"Even as civil rights groups suggest travelers should rethink trips to the state because of policies enacted by its Republican lawmakers, it remains a tourism juggernaut. And some visitors say their spending actually supports opposition to the new laws. For months leading up to Jean Franco Rivera’s one-year wedding anniversary, he had the perfect plan to celebrate: Travel to Disney World and go on all his favorite rides with his husband, Ahmed, and brother-in-law, Luis. The three men, all gay and Latino, are originally from Puerto Rico, but now live in Texas. As the trip approached, ‌Jean Franco, 42, said they felt somewhat concerned about traveling to a state that had passed legislation targeting L.G.B.T.Q. people in recent months."
Georgia,Q2,"Also, the Wagner chief begins exile in Belarus. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Justices on the country’s highest court rejected a legal theory that would have radically reshaped how elections are conducted by giving state legislatures largely unchecked power to set rules for federal elections and to draw congressional maps warped by partisan gerrymandering. The 6-to-3 decision was cheered by voting rights advocates who feared an undemocratic fallout if the Supreme Court had ruled the other way."

Georgia,Q2,"What should we make of the role that abortion played in both the Chicago and Wisconsin elections this week? The elections this week in Chicago and Wisconsin were different in many ways. One was for mayor, the other for a state Supreme Court seat. One was in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, the other in a closely divided swing state."

Georgia,Q2,"The Supreme Court will soon rule on race-conscious college admissions, a core Democratic issue. But an analysis of a California referendum points to a divide between the party and voters. The 2020 campaign to restore race-conscious affirmative action in California was close to gospel within the Democratic Party. It drew support from the governor, senators, state legislative leaders and a who’s who of business, nonprofit and labor elites, Black, Latino, white and Asian."
Georgia,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Georgia,Q2,"The $1.19 billion agreement, announced by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva, wouldn’t resolve all the claims against them. Three major chemical companies on Friday said they would pay more than $1 billion to settle the first in a wave of claims that they and other companies contaminated drinking water across the country with so-called forever chemicals that have been linked to cancer and other illnesses."
Georgia,Q2,"Apparently, the law is a little different for those at the top. The law is a little different for those at the top."
Georgia,Q3,"President Biden is making health care a key aspect of his reelection pitch. As his re-election effort gets underway, President Biden is signaling that health care — and particularly the cost of it — will be central to his campaign."
Georgia,Q3,"Also, drones hit deep inside Russia. Here's the latest at the end of Wednesday. Hurricane Idalia made landfall this morning in Florida’s Big Bend, hitting the area with heavy rain and devastating winds before marching northeast into Georgia. The storm severed power to hundreds of thousands of homes and left behind life-threatening floods across wide swaths of the region."
Georgia,Q3,"Mr. Wood wrote that the Georgia State Bar had “agreed to drop the disciplinary cases” against him if he retired from the profession. L. Lin Wood, one of the key lawyers who sought to overturn former President Donald J. Trump’s 2020 election loss and faced potential disciplinary action in Georgia as a result, opted to give up his law license in the state."
Georgia,Q3,"He still holds hands with his wife, Rosalynn, their grandson Josh Carter said. The family is making plans for the former president’s 99th birthday in October. Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, are still holding hands and making memories together in their Georgia home six months after he entered hospice care there, one of the couple’s grandsons said on Monday."
Georgia,Q3,"Also, the U.S. believes Prigozhin is dead. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. When Donald Trump is booked this evening on 13 state felony charges at a notorious jail in Georgia, it will be striking to see how the former president is treated. Trump for the first time will be required to pay bail, and he is expected to sit for a mug shot."
Georgia,Q3,"North Carolina and Georgia reported higher concentrations of smoke in new places. Smoke from wildfires in Canada that pushed deep into the United States this week has reached new areas in the South, including in North Carolina and Georgia, that had mostly escaped the toxic drift blowing in from the fires in June, officials said."
Georgia,Q3,"In an address, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, expressed support for Ukraine and several other nations joining the bloc over the next few years. The European Union’s top official on Wednesday called for a major expansion of the bloc to include not only Ukraine but also Moldova, several Western Balkan nations and Georgia over the next few years, a move that would push the group from 27 to over 30 members with more than half a billion citizens, and would make the world’s largest free-trade, free-travel area even larger."
Georgia,Q3,"This is the striking historical backdrop for Fani Willis’s indictment of Donald Trump. With her sweeping indictment of former President Donald Trump and over a dozen co-conspirators, the Fulton County, Ga., district attorney, Fani Willis, is now set to prosecute her case in a court of law. Just as important, it is essential that she and others continue to explain to the American public why the decision serves a critical purpose beyond the courts and for the health of our constitutional order."
Georgia,Q3,"Before he faces a jury, the former president must answer to his supporters. After three other criminal indictments were filed against him, Donald Trump was accused on Monday of racketeering. In a new indictment, Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., charged him with leading what was effectively a criminal gang to overturn the 2020 presidential election in that state."

Georgia,Q3,"The teacher in Georgia was fired for reading to fifth graders “My Shadow Is Purple,” which is about a child who cannot relate to the colors blue and pink. A teacher in an Atlanta suburb has been fired for reading a book to fifth-grade students that explores gender roles and identity through the eyes of a child who describes their shadow as purple, her lawyer said on Friday."
Georgia,Q3,"The death of an underage worker at a chicken plant in Hattiesburg, Miss., has put a spotlight on the rising number of child labor violations across the country. Federal authorities have opened an investigation into a Mississippi chicken plant after a 16-year-old boy died following a workplace accident there, officials said on Tuesday."
Georgia,Q3,"State flags mix aesthetics and nostalgia. Flags flutter over every state capital in the U.S. They bear emblems symbolizing the states they represent: a boldface C for Colorado, a lone star for Texas. They adorn magnets, mugs and T-shirts. They fly at half-staff in mourning."
Georgia,Q3,"About 30 percent of Americans have been addicted to opioids or have a relative who has been, researchers also reported. Roughly three in 10 adults have been addicted to opioids or have a family member who has been, and less than half of those with a substance use disorder have received treatment, according to a new survey conducted by KFF, a health policy research group."
Georgia,Q3,"A new study finds that private equity firms own more than half of all specialists in certain U.S. markets. In recent years, private equity firms have been gobbling up physician practices to form powerful medical groups across the country, according to a new report released Monday."
Georgia,Q3,"The bacteria are found in raw seafood, like oysters, and warm, brackish waters. Climate change may increase the risk of infections from the deadly bacteria farther north. Three people in the New York City area have died in recent weeks and a fourth person was hospitalized after contracting infections from a flesh-eating bacteria that can be caused by eating raw oysters or swimming in saltwater, health officials in New York and Connecticut said."

Georgia,Q3,"So far, 24 states have eliminated sales taxes on period products that have been criticized as discriminatory. On Friday, a bipartisan Texas bill that eliminates sales taxes on menstrual products went into effect, making it the 24th state in the country, as well as District of Columbia, to remove what is colloquially known as the “tampon tax.”"
Georgia,Q3,"Now that the U.S. government has stepped back from issuing vaccines, long-term care operators have yet to start administering shots to protect one of the most vulnerable populations. “Covid is not pretty in a nursing home,” said Deb Wityk, a 70-year-old retired massage therapist who lives in one called Spurgeon Manor, in rural Iowa. She has contracted the disease twice, and is eager to get the newly approved vaccine because she has chronic leukemia, which weakens her immune system."
Georgia,Q3,"Some say the facilities, which focus on autonomy in childbirth, could lead to better health outcomes — but officials are tightening rules, citing risk. Gabrielle Glaze felt scolded and shamed when she delivered her first son in a Birmingham, Ala., hospital, forced to observe strict rules about lying stationary through her contractions and enduring countless cervical checks from “total strangers” who seemed disappointed by her body’s progress."
Georgia,Q3,"President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate some drug prices, a change that the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have opposed for decades. As he heads toward a re-election campaign next year, President Biden is betting that his success in pushing for policies intended to lower health care costs for millions of Americans will be rewarded by voters at the ballot box."
Georgia,Q3,"Mr. Kennedy, the proposed nominee for health secretary, has for decades promoted baseless conspiracy theories. He has promoted a conspiracy theory that coronavirus vaccines were developed to control people via microchips. He has endorsed the false notion that antidepressants are linked to school shootings. And he has pushed the decades-old idea that the C.I.A. killed his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy."
Georgia,Q3,"States defending transition care bans for minors have had success in the courts recently after a series of early victories for transgender rights advocates. A federal appellate panel said Monday that Alabama’s ban on hormone treatments and puberty blockers for transgender young people could be enforced, the latest in a series of courtroom setbacks for transgender rights advocates."
Georgia,Q3,"After Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, some feared that other court rulings, including the 2003 decision that invalidated sodomy laws, could be revisited. Maryland and Minnesota recently repealed theirs. It has been 20 years since the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws with its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, but legal codes inherited from colonial laws and used to prosecute L.G.B.T.Q. people by banning some sexual acts remain in place across the country."
Georgia,Q3,"If you want to move more, look to your childhood and let things get silly. Growing up, Kyle Luigs was a shy kid who loved sports. He finished his sophomore year pitching for the University of North Georgia in 2018 and needed somewhere to play during the summer, so he decided to try out for a team called the Savannah Bananas."
Georgia,Q3,"Americans are drinking more water. How best to contain it: That’s the burning question. Carrie Frost is well equipped for hydration. A registered nurse and a mother of two from Colorado, she estimates that her family has accumulated “upward of 25 to 30” reusable flasks at home for keeping cold drinks: flasks large and small, of various designs and colors, with a straw and without. But last month, as she sat in 90-degree heat at her son’s travel baseball tournament, she drank from a plastic water bottle that she had purchased for $3 at a local grocery store."
Georgia,Q3,"The judge who sentenced Joseph Morelli deferred a decision on whether Mr. Morelli must pay Ms. Greene $65,000 for a fence she installed at her Georgia home. An upstate New York man who admitted threatening to harm Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and show her “what violence truly is” in a series of phone calls to her Washington office last year was sentenced on Thursday to three months in prison."
Georgia,Q3,"As climate change sends summer temperatures soaring, older people are increasingly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses in places like Phoenix. In 2015, when Diana and Charles Cox were considering where to retire, they drove their R.V. across the Southwest to visit several possibilities: Santa Fe, Sedona, Phoenix, Las Vegas."
Georgia,Q3,"The California governor had taunted his Florida counterpart for months. Now, with his presidential campaign struggling, Mr. DeSantis agreed to a debate hosted by Sean Hannity. Since last September, Gavin Newsom, the ambitious, proudly liberal governor of California, has been tauntingly challenging Ron DeSantis, the ambitious, proudly conservative governor of Florida, to a debate. He would even agree, he said, to let the right-wing Fox News host Sean Hannity moderate."
Georgia,Q3,"Scientists and educators are searching for ways to improve air quality in the nation’s often dilapidated school buildings. On a sunny afternoon in a cluttered music room at East High in Denver, two sophomores practiced violin while their music teacher, Keith Oxman, labored over a desk in an adjoining office."
Georgia,Q3,"Indictments and debate drama ensure that the primary revolves around him. There was a time, not all that long ago, when being indicted was bad for a politician’s career. That time is over — at least for Donald Trump."
Georgia,Q3,"As the Republican presidential candidates campaign under the shadow of a front-runner facing dozens of felony charges, The New York Times examined their stances on key issues. As the Republican presidential candidates campaign under the shadow of a front-runner facing dozens of felony charges, The New York Times examined their stances on key issues."
Georgia,Q3,"Donald Trump’s response to another criminal indictment. Donald Trump has 10 days to turn himself in, as he faces accusations that he and 18 other people orchestrated a “criminal enterprise” to reverse the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. The sweeping charges, which were brought on Monday night by a local prosecutor in Atlanta, fall under the state’s racketeering statute, which was originally designed to dismantle organized crime groups."
Georgia,Q3,"G.O.P. leaders acceded to the demands of ultraconservatives to use the annual defense policy bill to lodge cultural grievances and protest continued U.S. support for Ukraine. Now its fate is in doubt. A divided House voted on Thursday to restrict abortion access, bar transgender health services and limit diversity training for military personnel, potentially imperiling passage of the annual defense bill as Republicans, goaded by their right flank, loaded the measure with conservative policy dictates."

Georgia,Q3,"Public health crises don’t operate on the same timetable as academic journals. When my colleague Stephanie Nolen began working on an article earlier this year about new technologies to fight mosquito-borne diseases, she assumed she would be writing a story of continued progress."
Georgia,Q3,"Some employers said they were losing workers because of the new law, which was championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. After signing into law a raft of new measures aimed at undocumented immigrants in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the legislation gave the state “the most ambitious anti-illegal immigration laws in the country.”"
Georgia,Q3,"Former brides reveal where they splurged and where they scrimped for their nuptials — and what (if anything) they would have done differently. One couple spent less than $2,000 for an intimate wedding at a local hotel. Another paid $200,000 for an elaborate out-of-town affair. We asked six married women to share how much they spent on their weddings — and where they felt the money was well-spent, where it was wasted and what they wish they had done differently."
Georgia,Q3,"Early data suggest laws to increase semiconductor production and renewable energy technology have shifted the makeup of foreign direct investment — but not increased it. Lucrative new tax breaks and other incentives for advanced manufacturing that President Biden signed into law appear to be reshaping direct foreign investment in the American economy, according to a White House analysis, with a much greater share of spending on new and expanded businesses shifting toward the factory sector."
Georgia,Q3,More than 57 million people were under an excessive heat warning — the most severe category for heat conditions — and another 54 million people were under a heat advisory. More than 57 million people in the American South and Southwest were under an excessive heat warning on Saturday afternoon — the most severe category for heat conditions — as temperatures across the Gulf Coast and parts of the Southwest soared to record-breaking levels and were expected to remain high through early next week.
Georgia,Q3,"How hot is it? No single temperature reading can capture the nation’s misery, so we’ve assembled a lot of figures to put the oppressive heat in context. All signs indicate that this will be one of the hottest summers on record, as a heat wave scorches the Northern Hemisphere. Large portions of the United States are sweating through oppressive conditions that show no signs of easing, accompanied by a growing death toll."
Georgia,Q3,"Also, the first Republican debate is tonight. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner private military company who staged a brief mutiny this summer against Russia’s military leadership, was listed as a passenger on a private jet that crashed today. Russian aviation authorities said that all 10 people aboard were killed."
Georgia,Q3,"Do we own our bodies? The answer, according to many legal experts, is no. Do we own our bodies? To an ordinary person, the answer is obviously yes. To a lawyer, it’s not at all clear. That discrepancy needs to be resolved."
Georgia,Q3,"Susan Escallier, who served for 32 years, will be the new convening authority for the Sept. 11, U.S.S. Cole and Bali bombing cases at Guantánamo. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has chosen a former career Army lawyer who served in Iraq to oversee the Guantánamo war court, a job that includes approving plea deals and deciding whether prosecutors can seek death sentences."
Georgia,Q3,"The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water. The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water."
Georgia,Q3,"Senator Joe Manchin III and former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. stressed that they were not a third-party presidential ticket — yet. And on issues like climate and guns, they debated their views. As the ostensibly bipartisan interest group No Labels discovered on Monday, consensus campaigning and governance is all well and good until it comes time for the details."
Georgia,Q3,"A late-summer rise in Covid-19 infections is bringing with it a wave of conspiracy theories. As Covid-19 cases have climbed as part of a late-summer uptick, right-wing influencers and conspiracy theorists have responded by stoking fears about mass lockdowns and spreading unsubstantiated new ideas about Covid-19’s links to world events."
Georgia,Q3,"It isn’t every generation that produces a president who is charged with 91 counts by two local D.A.s and one special counsel. Bret Stephens: Before we get to Donald Trump’s indictment in Georgia or the upcoming G.O.P. debate, I want to take note of the appalling tragedy in Hawaii. The images from Maui are just heartbreaking. But I also get a sense that heartbreak will soon turn to outrage as we learn more about the cascade of policy failures that led to the disaster."
Georgia,Q3,"Also, Hilary’s impact in Southern California. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. President Biden landed this evening in Hawaii, where he planned to inspect the damage wrought by the wildfires that killed more than 100 people and effectively wiped out a coastal town on the island of Maui nearly two weeks ago. "

Georgia,Q4,"Former President Jimmy Carter emerged from hospice care to join a cast of political heavyweights paying tribute to Mrs. Carter, who died at 96 last week at her home in Plains, Ga. Her journey took her from the smallest of small towns in rural Georgia to the majesty of the White House, from the campaign trails of Iowa and New Hampshire to refugee camps in Asia and impoverished villages in Africa."
Georgia,Q4,"A simple red brick church where Mrs. Carter had worshiped for decades was filled on Wednesday with the people who had known her best. To them, she was more than a first lady."

Georgia,Q4,"From Capitol Hill to Hollywood, the late night hosts had lots to discuss, including a federal grand jury charging Hunter Biden with scheming to evade taxes, the start of Rudy Giuliani’s defamation trial and Taylor Swift’s birthday. Here's what they had to say. From Capitol Hill to Hollywood, the late night hosts had lots to discuss, including a federal grand jury charging Hunter Biden with scheming to evade taxes, the start of Rudy Giuliani’s defamation trial and Taylor Swift’s birthday. Here's what they had to say."
Georgia,Q4,"The increases were particularly stark among babies born to Native American, Alaska Native and white mothers in 2022. Rates among Black infants remained highest of all. The number of American babies who died before their first birthdays rose last year, significantly increasing the nation’s infant mortality rate for the first time in two decades, according to provisional figures released Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics."
Georgia,Q4,"Also, Israel intensified its airstrikes in Gaza. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. House Republicans voted this afternoon to nominate Tom Emmer — a Representative from Minnesota who holds the No. 3 leadership post — to be the chamber’s next speaker. But within hours, he dropped his bid."
Georgia,Q4,"Schools for children of military members achieve results rarely seen in public education. Amy Dilmar, a middle-school principal in Georgia, is well aware of the many crises threatening American education. The lost learning that piled up during the coronavirus pandemic. The gaping inequalities by race and family income that have only gotten worse. A widening achievement gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students."
Georgia,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Georgia,Q4,"Immigrants who worked decades on U.S. farms are reaching retirement age in a country that offers them neither Medicare nor Social Security. Esperanza Sanchez spends eight hours a day, Sunday to Friday, crouched down to the ground, trimming and picking leafy greens and packing them into boxes."
Georgia,Q4,"The virus, which recently reached the Antarctic region for the first time, is surging again in North America. Over the last three years, a highly contagious, often deadly form of bird flu has taken a staggering toll on animals around the globe."
Georgia,Q4,"The Gullah Geechee fight to preserve the tiny structures, a cradle of the Black church, before they’re erased by sprawl, climate change and fading memories. The Rev. Kay Colleton will never forget the time she first laid eyes on Moving Star Hall, a tiny white clapboard building with a leaning chimney, a crooked roof and a storied history. The hall is a rare surviving example of a praise house — humble one-room structures used as places of worship by enslaved people on coastal plantations throughout the Carolinas and Georgia. They have been providing spiritual sustenance for generations of African Americans ever since."
Georgia,Q4,"Transgender minors in the state will be able to receive gender transition care for now, while the challenge against the state ban proceeds. A federal judge in Idaho temporarily blocked the enforcement of a state law on Tuesday that bans gender transition care for minors and threatens medical professionals with a felony conviction if they provide such care, just six days before it was set to take effect."
Georgia,Q4,"The senior staff in the Carter White House often wished the stubborn president would listen even more to his impressive wife, especially on politics. I saw Rosalynn Carter angry only twice. Both occasions involved Ronald Reagan, who had crushed Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election, and both reflected her passion and decency."
Georgia,Q4,"The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term. The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows."
Georgia,Q4,"For starters, we heard something unexpected from both Democrats and Republicans about the economy. For starters, we heard something unexpected from both Democrats and Republicans about the economy."
Georgia,Q4,"Also, U.S. economic growth accelerates. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. Hundreds of police officers combed a vast, largely rural area of Maine, hunting for the suspect in shootings last night that killed 18 people and injured 13 others in a crowded bowling alley and at a bar in Lewiston."
Georgia,Q4,"Mr. Chesebro, a buttoned-down Harvard lawyer, evolved from left-leaning jurist to key player in the Trump false electors scandal. What happened? In the winter of 2000, Kenneth Chesebro was a mild-mannered Harvard lawyer toiling for Al Gore during the presidential election recount battle. Two decades later, on Jan. 6, 2021, he joined the mob outside the Capitol, reborn as a MAGA-hatted kingpin."
Georgia,Q4,"There are two Americas, and they are divided by a college degree. By many measures, the U.S. economy is thriving: Unemployment stands close to the 50-year low set in April, the fraction of people age 25 to 54 in work is at a two-decade high, gross domestic product is growing rapidly, inflation is falling, and the S&P 500 is a third higher than it was before the Covid pandemic."
Georgia,Q4,"She was the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. Why have her efforts been so overlooked? When Americans look back and take stock of their most impressive first ladies, they rarely think of Rosalynn Carter."
Georgia,Q4,"If we came to think of Trump derangement syndrome as a mental health problem, who do you think would be the first person diagnosed? Sometimes I miss the good old days when Donald Trump could be shocking."
Georgia,Q4,"Their marriage was admired for its endurance — 77 years — and for the affection between the two people in it. “It radiated,” one acquaintance said. There was a time, Rosalynn Carter once confessed, when she dreaded going back to Plains, her tiny Georgia hometown. Actually, she was furious about it."
Georgia,Q4,"Mrs. Carter transformed the unelected, unpaid and sometimes unappreciated position of first lady in ways that reverberate to this day. Some two decades after leaving the White House, Rosalynn Carter reflected on the criticism she generated for expanding the role of a first lady. “You can’t let it stop you,” she told an interviewer. “I didn’t let it stop me.”"
Georgia,Q4,"Arizona spent $1 billion on addiction treatment, much of it fraudulent, officials said. Scores of Native Americans who sought help are still struggling with untreated addiction — and some died in rehab. The white vans were the first thing people noticed."
Georgia,Q4,"Articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."
Georgia,Q4,"The SAG-AFTRA vote formally ends six months of labor strife, though some members were not happy about the contract’s artificial intelligence protections. Actors have voted to approve a new three-year contract with studios although some union members remained dissatisfied with the deal’s artificial intelligence protections. The ratification formally ended six months of labor unrest in the entertainment industry."
Georgia,Q4,"Ron DeSantis showed a feistier side, using a friendly moderator to go on offense. Gavin Newsom defended California and President Biden, and jabbed right back. For an hour and a half on Thursday night, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California shouted at and interrupted each other, trying to leave an impression on Fox News viewers beyond the din of their slugfest."
Georgia,Q4,"The first full-year census of U.S. abortion providers shows significant increases in abortion in states where it’s legal. In the year after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion, something unexpected happened: The total number of legal abortions in the United States did not fall. Instead, it appeared to increase slightly, by about 0.2 percent, according to the first full-year count of abortions provided nationwide."
Georgia,Q4,"The president’s push to focus attention on the domestic economy comes as his administration has been dealing with events overseas after the terrorist attacks in Israel. President Biden on Wednesday began a tour of rural communities at a Minnesota hog farm where he lamented the loss of family farms, attacked the corporate consolidation of agriculture and pledged to oversee a renaissance of the American heartland."
Georgia,Q4,"As Congress struggles to do the bare minimum of keeping the government funded, House Republicans are using the annual federal spending bills to try to punish the Biden administration. Just before hard-right House Republicans staged a floor mutiny over spending on Wednesday that sent lawmakers home early for their Thanksgiving break, they managed one final vote, on a measure to reduce the salary of an obscure Biden administration official to $1."
Georgia,Q4,"Tough regulation is needed to combat abusive practices. In 1994, the 15-year-old Liz Ianelli was sent by her parents to the Family Foundation School in Hancock, N.Y., which claimed to treat her disruptive behavior. But she said her “therapy” for most of the next three years consisted of daily emotional attacks by staff and fellow students, forced labor, food deprivation and other assaults. While there, she was also raped by a kitchen employee, she said. Then, as punishment for “lying” about it, she was bound in a blanket with duct tape and left in a boiler room for eight days."
Georgia,Q4,"Also, Jim Jordan loses a vote to be speaker. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. An explosion killed hundreds of people today at a hospital in Gaza that was packed with civilians sheltering there, Palestinian officials said. Palestinians and Israelis blamed each other for the blast, and the tragedy could reshape the conflict just as President Biden is expected to arrive in Israel tomorrow."
Georgia,Q4,Have you been paying attention to the news recently? See how many of these 10 questions you can get right. Have you been paying attention to the news recently? See how many of these 10 questions you can get right.
Georgia,Q4,"“Come hell or high water, Jimmy Carter was going to use his inner resources to be there,” the presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said of Mr. Carter’s emerging from hospice care for his wife’s memorial service. His face was pale and gaunt, his legs were wrapped in a blanket, and his eyes never seemed to make contact with the family members huddled around him. But on Tuesday, Jimmy Carter was there, in the front row of a church in Atlanta, just a few feet from the coffin holding Rosalynn Carter, his wife of 77 years."
Georgia,Q4,"The divisions are erupting as the House weighs a G.O.P. bid to censure the only Palestinian-American member of Congress for criticizing Israel and votes on a large aid bill to back Israel in the war in Gaza. Israel’s war against Hamas is exposing deep divisions among Democrats in Congress, as the most outspoken supporters of the Jewish state and vocal pro-Palestinian members on the left trade accusations of bigotry and feud over what role the United States should play in the hostilities."
Georgia,Q4,"A conversation with Miriam Jordan, who covers immigration for The New York Times. At least 40 percent of crop workers in the United States do not have legal immigration status. Americans typically aren’t willing to do backbreaking work in the fields, farmers say."
Georgia,Q4,"Refusing to listen to the other side of a debate doesn’t have a very good record of success. In our polarized society, the simple act of listening to people with whom you disagree — let alone working with them — can be grounds for rebuke."
Georgia,Q4,"Plus remembering Park Seo-Bo and his art. The Israeli military said yesterday that it had stepped up its bombardment of Gaza, where Palestinian officials said that hundreds of people had been killed. Diplomatic pressure grew for Israel to delay its ground invasion of the enclave."
Georgia,Q4,"The group discusses what the Democratic Party means to them, its current strategy and its future after Biden. The group discusses what the Democratic Party means to them, its current strategy and its future after Biden."
Georgia,Q4,"Also, House Republicans struggle to choose a leader. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. Israel moved troops into position for a multipronged invasion of the Gaza Strip in an effort to dismantle Hamas, the militant group who massacred more than 1,200 Israelis in an attack over the weekend. "
Georgia,Q4,Experts offer tips on what to do if you’re not getting the respect or compensation you deserve. Life isn’t fair.
Georgia,Q4,"The new Republican speaker is facing fury from ultraconservative lawmakers for agreeing to drop limits on abortion, transgender care and diversity training. The annual defense bill has become entangled in a tumultuous Republican feud in the House, as hard-right lawmakers revolt over a bipartisan agreement to jettison a raft of deeply partisan dictates that would have limited abortion access, transgender care and diversity training."
Georgia,Q4,"Also, Biden plans to skip the U.N. climate summit. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. Israel and Hamas agreed today to extend by two days a cease-fire that has brought a measure of calm to the Gaza Strip after seven weeks of intense warfare, according to officials in Qatar who were involved in the negotiations. The two sides struck a deal to exchange more hostages and prisoners and allow more aid into Gaza."
Georgia,Q4,"An Israeli raid on Al-Shifa Hospital. The Israeli military said early this morning that its troops were raiding Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, a complex of buildings where thousands of people have sheltered and conditions for patients have grown increasingly grim as supplies have dwindled. Fighting has been raging nearby for days, and the hospital was struck at least four times over the weekend."
Georgia,Q4,"Also, America’s deficit doubled. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. Hamas released an American mother and daughter who were kidnapped by the Palestinian group during its deadly Oct. 7 attack and held hostage for almost two weeks in Gaza. The Israeli military received them at the border and took them to an army base in central Israel to be reunited with family members."
Georgia,Q4,"Also, Republicans nominate Jim Jordan for speaker. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. There was a palpable sense of crisis in the Gaza Strip today. Thousands of residents raced to flee their homes in the hours after Israeli officials called for more than a million civilians to evacuate south in just 24 hours, ahead of a potential ground invasion."
Georgia,Q4,"New York Times/Siena College polling painted a worrisome picture of the president’s standing with a crucial constituency. Democratic strategists warned that the erosion could threaten his re-election. Black voters are more disconnected from the Democratic Party than they have been in decades, frustrated with what many see as inaction on their political priorities and unhappy with President Biden, a candidate they helped lift to the White House just three years ago."
Georgia,Q4,"The lives of hundreds of thousands of crew members have been upended, and even a deal between the actors and the studios might not help much in the short term. Katie Reis has been a Hollywood lighting technician for 27 years, rigging equipment for movies like “Independence Day” and TV shows like “Quantum Leap.” But she hasn’t had a paycheck since May, when the first of two strikes — screenwriters, then actors — forced cameras to stop rolling."
Georgia,Q4,"Medical scientists and the military are looking into whether Robert Card’s psychological collapse was linked to brain damage from his role as a grenade instructor. After a 40-year-old Army Reservist named Robert Card went on a shooting spree in Lewiston, Maine, in October, his community grasped for answers."
Hawaii,Q1,"The products, which were sold at Trader Joe’s, Costco, Aldi and other retailers, have been linked to five cases of illness, a federal agency said. Frozen organic strawberries sold at Costco, Aldi, Trader Joe’s and other retailers have been recalled after the products were linked to five cases of hepatitis A in Washington State, the Food and Drug Administration said."

Hawaii,Q1,"The marquee committee of the new Republican majority opened its first hearing by rehashing complaints about the treatment of former President Donald J. Trump and others. Even Fox News cut away. WASHINGTON — When hard-right Republicans extracted concessions from Speaker Kevin McCarthy in exchange for supporting his election last month, one of their top demands was that he robustly fund and give sweeping jurisdiction to a special subcommittee to investigate their claims of pervasive bias in the federal government against conservatives."
Hawaii,Q1,"The legislative calendar is packed with 300 abortion bills. “You can’t go to jail for screwing up an appendectomy,” one lawmaker said. For the first time since the fight over abortion access was kicked to the states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, newly elected legislatures around the country are coming into session and are putting the polarizing issue at the top of their agendas. Around 300 bills in 40 states have been proposed so far — with a majority seeking to restrict access to abortion, and others trying to strengthen it."
Hawaii,Q1,"In less than two decades, it’s expected that five million people will travel internationally for business or leisure every single day. Tourism already accounts for between 8 percent and 11 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, an amount that’s unlikely to shrink if left unchecked. "
Hawaii,Q1,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Hawaii,Q1,"A conversation with the five-time Grammy-winning singer who is the subject of a new career-spanning documentary, “Dionne Warwick: Don’t Make Me Over.” Dionne Warwick refuses to stay put. At 82, the five-time Grammy-winning artist is making stops in Hawaii and Vancouver on her One Last Time tour — she won’t say whether it’s truly her last — tweeting (or “twoting,” as she calls it) to her more than half a million followers, and making appearances on “S.N.L.” and on movie soundtracks like Jordan Peele’s “Nope.” When she retires, she said, she’ll move to Brazil."
Hawaii,Q1,"The justices found that the state’s Constitution does not include a right to the procedure, bringing an end to a monthslong legal battle. Idaho’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition on abortion in a ruling Thursday night that said the State Constitution does not include a right to the procedure."
Hawaii,Q1,"Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania opened 92 percent of state government jobs to people without four-year degrees. Gov. Jim Pillen of Nebraska created a state office focused on broadband access. After a midterm election year in which statewide races were almost entirely wrapped up in national issues — abortion and democracy — the nation’s newly elected governors are showing their ambitions with a mix of virtue-signaling on national issues, currying favor with their political bases and, for some, reaching out to broader constituencies."
Hawaii,Q1,"A scramble to mine the deep sea could soon commence. And once it begins, there will be little hope of reining it in. Descending to the depths of the ocean is part of my job as a deep-sea biologist. Traveling three miles below the sea surface never ceases to uplift me. I’ve seen strange and wonderful creatures, from anemones with seven-foot tentacles that billow across the seafloor, to sharks that glow in the dark, 1,000-year-old corals and blind white crabs sustained by bacteria they cultivate on their claws."
Hawaii,Q1,"As a long-distance, open-water swimmer, she braved waves, sharks and darkness to break 18 world records. It was 3 a.m. on Oct. 5, 1958, when Greta Andersen emerged from the icy surf onto the beach at Emerald Bay, on Catalina Island off the California coast, bleeding, bruised and numb with cold, as The Los Angeles Times reported a year later."
Hawaii,Q1,"The death toll of a major earthquake in Turkey. A powerful earthquake that hit at 4:17 a.m. yesterday close to the border of Turkey and Syria has wrought devastation, killed more than 4,300 people and raised the specter of a new humanitarian disaster in an already troubled area of the world. Rescuers are searching for survivors in near-freezing temperatures and are facing what one expert called “a race against time and hypothermia.” Follow the latest updates."
Hawaii,Q1,"It’s now an official state holiday. This Sunday is Lunar New Year, when the moon will enter a new phase and usher in the Year of the Rabbit. And for the first time in California’s history, it’s an official state holiday."
Hawaii,Q1,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Hawaii,Q1,"Also, Poland says it will give Ukraine warplanes and Japan extends a hand to South Korea. President Emmanuel Macron pushed through contentious legislation to raise France’s retirement age — without a full vote in parliament. The decision inflamed tensions and set the stage for a no-confidence vote against his government."
Hawaii,Q1,"White researchers fared best in winning grants from the National Science Foundation, a study says. Asians encounter the highest rate of rejections, challenging an academic stereotype. White scientists are generally more successful at winning federal research money from the National Science Foundation than Black, Latino and other nonwhite scientists, a new study finds."
Hawaii,Q1,"A meeting in Germany of Ukraine’s allies. Around 50 allies of Ukraine will meet at Ramstein Air Base in Germany today to chart the next steps in the defense of Ukraine. Already, they have made it clear that they intend to furnish a major infusion of military aid that is expected to total billions of dollars’ worth of matériel to help the country fend off Russian aggression as the war nears its first anniversary."
Hawaii,Q1,"Ann Napolitano toiled in obscurity for years. Novels went unpublished; agents turned her down. She found recognition with “Dear Edward.” Then came the call: “Hello Beautiful” was the 100th pick for what is arguably the most influential book club in the world. Maybe it was fate, maybe it was the meddling of a higher power with a wicked sense of humor. Either way, Ann Napolitano was taking out the garbage when Oprah Winfrey called to tell her that her novel, “Hello Beautiful,” is the 100th selection for what is arguably the most influential book club in the world."
Hawaii,Q1,"Arriving in record numbers, they’re ending up in dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws — including in factories that make products for well-known brands like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom. It was almost midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich., but inside the factory everything was bright. A conveyor belt carried bags of Cheerios past a cluster of young workers. One was 15-year-old Carolina Yoc, who came to the United States on her own last year to live with a relative she had never met."
Hawaii,Q1,"For years, Eve Morawski waged an epic battle against real estate investors who bought her tax debt and ultimately seized her Maplewood, N.J., home. MAPLEWOOD, N.J. — It was dark by the time Eve Morawski managed to break into her home of 60 years."
Hawaii,Q1,"The software giant faces mounting pressure from activist investors and pushback from employees unhappy about a wave of firings and the scaling back of office perks. Wednesday’s earnings report by Salesforce may be the most closely watched in the software giant’s 24-year history. Investors — especially the now half-dozen activist shareholders who are clamoring for change at the company, and possibly board seats — will be eager to hear how its chief, Marc Benioff, plans to turn around its fortunes."
Hawaii,Q1,"Some younger Asian Americans are creating their own holiday traditions, putting a spin on lessons they’ve learned. Hands jostled around a large metal basin, plastic gloves crinkling as they massaged pounds of julienned radish, green onion and a spicy, fragrant paste of red pepper flakes, brined shrimp, ginger and garlic."
Hawaii,Q1,"Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind. The 2023 tax filing season is probably most notable for what’s missing: After three years of stimulus payments and pandemic tax breaks, nearly all of those extra benefits have faded away — and tax refunds are likely to shrink as a result."
Hawaii,Q1,"“That toothsome meal arguably saved the Republic,” says the journalist, whose new book is “Dinner With the President: Food, Politics, and a History of Breaking Bread at the White House,” of Thomas Jefferson’s so-called Dinner Table Bargain. “The debate at Jefferson’s reverberates today.” I have a colorful pile of books that is slowly accreting by my bed, and occasionally sets off a landslide. At the moment the stratum includes: George Saunders’s “A Swim in a Pond in the Rain,” Geoff Dyer’s “The Last Days of Roger Federer,” Toni Tipton-Martin’s “Jubilee” cookbook, Patti Smith’s “M Train,” Mark Strand’s “Hopper,” Mark Rozzo’s “Everybody Thought We Were Crazy,” Ian Fleming’s “Thrilling Cities” (a 1963 travelogue picked up for 10 cents), Sally Mann’s “Hold Still” and a substrate of magazines and catalogs. I dip in and out of these books before sleep, or when I’m procrastinating, and will eventually finish them all. Or not."
Hawaii,Q1,"Many of the nation’s major cities face a daunting future. On the last day of February, Glen Lee, the chief financial officer of Washington, D.C., issued a warning to the mayor and members of the District of Columbia Council, who are undertaking such costly ventures as free bus service and expanded affordable housing."

Hawaii,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Hawaii,Q2,For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted. For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted.
Hawaii,Q2,"The Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade has produced some unexpected legal and political changes, as well as a shift in public opinion. In the year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, some of the results of the decision have been unsurprising — more than a dozen Republican-led states have moved to ban most abortions, and dozens of abortion clinics have closed. Yet there have also been unexpected legal and political changes that have left Americans on both sides of the issue scrambling to adapt. Here are five major changes detailed in The New York Times’s coverage of the first anniversary of the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ended the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years."
Hawaii,Q2,"In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities.

Hawaii,Q2,"In the 1990s, the U.S. government limited what young people could see online, but lost a court fight challenging those rules. Now it’s happening again. Mounting concerns over young people’s mental health have prompted state legislatures across the country to propose a slew of age restrictions to protect minors online. Lawmakers say the rules should help shield young people from online pornography, predators and harmful social media posts."
Hawaii,Q2,"Revelations that migrant children have been exploited for cheap labor brought calls for action, but a partisan battle over immigration policy has complicated lawmakers’ efforts. Weeks after revelations that migrant children are being regularly exploited for cheap labor in the United States prompted bipartisan outrage and calls to action on Capitol Hill, Congress has moved no closer to addressing the issue, which has become mired in a long-running partisan war over immigration policy."
Hawaii,Q2,"Also, American miscalculations in Sudan. Two explosions occurred 15 minutes apart over the Kremlin early yesterday, video footage verified by The Times showed. The incident set off a flurry of accusations and escalated tensions between Russia and Ukraine."
Hawaii,Q2,"Conservatives are so wrong so often that they are pumping us liberals full of worrying smugness. It was easy for my generation of baby boomer liberals to be humble, because we had much to be humble about."
Hawaii,Q2,"Greg Gutfeld has installed his brand of insult conservatism as the institutional voice for the next generation of Fox News viewer. And it’s catching on. One evening in May, the most-watched man in late-night television these days staked out a curious if characteristic position: A 38-year-old teacher who allegedly had sex with a 16-year-old student, the host said, was the hero this nation needed."
Hawaii,Q2,"The group discusses the economy, union membership and politics. The group discusses the economy, union membership and politics."
Hawaii,Q2,"He helped the Sierra Club fight a plan to build dams in the Grand Canyon and started a think tank to warn of the effects of economic globalization. Jerry Mander, whose iconoclastic thinking led him to create advertising campaigns for nonprofits, like one for the Sierra Club in 1966 to fight a plan to build two dams in the Grand Canyon, and to found an organization to raise awareness about the dangers of economic globalization, died on April 11 at his home in Honokaa, Hawaii. He was 86."
Hawaii,Q2,Does talk therapy work? It’s complicated. Millions of Americans go to talk therapy. But does it work? It’s a surprisingly difficult question to answer.
Hawaii,Q2,"A federal judge in Washington State issued a ruling ordering the Food and Drug Administration to make no changes to the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone on Friday, directly contradicting another judge’s ruling in a legal standoff likely to escalate to the Supreme Court.

Hawaii,Q2,"As a record number of people die on America’s streets, Abdul Curry fights to stay alive. Laine Goettsch packed her emergency medical bag and drove into downtown San Diego to look for her favorite patient, afraid of what she might find. Sometimes, she saw Abdul Curry cleaning the sidewalks near his tent and dancing to a playlist of Ed Sheeran songs. Other times, she found him hypothermic in a wet sleeping bag and surrounded by people smoking fentanyl. And then there were the days when she couldn’t find him at all, and she continued searching for hours as she braced for a call from the hospital, the police or the medical examiner."
Hawaii,Q2,"San Francisco has proposed the nation’s most ambitious reparations plan, including $5 million cash payments and housing aid that aims to bring people back. SAN FRANCISCO — Standing at the stoop of her childhood home — a slim but stately Victorian shaded by an evergreen pear tree — Lynette Mackey pulled up a photo of a family gathering from nearly 50 years ago. The men were all in suits, the women in skirts. Ms. Mackey, a teenager in red bell bottoms, stretched her arms wide and had a beaming smile."
Hawaii,Q2,"Buoyed by a $2.3 million grant, the archive hopes increased visibility on the first-person accounts of incarcerated people can serve as a road map for policy reforms. At an age when his peers were getting driver’s licenses and thinking about college, Jose Di Lenola, then 17, was behind bars in one of New York State’s most violent prisons, earning “a master’s degree in Prison Survival,” as he put it. He learned how to wield a metal can lid as a weapon and fashion a protective vest out of magazine covers taped to his torso."

Hawaii,Q3,"Maui County’s lawsuit against some of the world’s largest oil and gas companies is still winding its way through state court. The words were strikingly prescient: Because of climate change, lush and verdant Maui was facing wildfires of “increased frequency, intensity, and destructive force.”"
Hawaii,Q3,"As President Biden arrives to survey the damage with state and local officials, shock and grief are giving way to anger and questions about the government’s preparation. It was the firestorm that wildfire experts and residents on Maui had warned about for years — a blaze fueled by hurricane winds roaring through untamed grasses and into a 13,000-person coastal town with few ways in or out. Local officials had released plan after plan acknowledging that wildfire was all but certain."
Hawaii,Q3,"Nearly 60 percent of Lahaina students haven’t enrolled in classes after the deadly fire, and families are yearning to rebuild their school network for educational and emotional support. The flames that ripped through Lahaina needed only a few hours to take nearly everything from Aina Kohler. Her house. Her surfing school and cafe. And her parents’ home, where she was raised."
Hawaii,Q3,"The court ruled that women seeking abortion pills must first see a doctor in person. The catch: The nearest abortion doctor is an eight-hour flight away. A federal appeals court ruled late Tuesday that women on the American territory of Guam who are seeking medication abortion must first have an in-person consultation with a doctor, which is likely to make access to the procedure on the remote island even more difficult."
Hawaii,Q3,"“We’re the last resort,” one young activist said. As Kaliko Teruya was coming home from her hula lesson on August 8, her father called. The apartment in Lahaina was gone, he said, and he was running for his life."
Hawaii,Q3,"Still, there are fewer than 200 cases nationally each year, and the numbers have fallen significantly from the peak decades ago. Leprosy, a fearsome scourge of ancient civilizations, may have become a permanent fixture in Florida, according to a new study."
Hawaii,Q3,"The toll from wildfires in Hawaii. More than 50 people have died in devastating wildfires on the Hawaii island of Maui. Survivors described fleeing for their lives from a fast-moving “total inferno” that left the town of Lahaina in smoking ruins. Thousands of people filled evacuation shelters, and tourists continued a grim exodus to the airport."
Hawaii,Q3,"So far, 24 states have eliminated sales taxes on period products that have been criticized as discriminatory. On Friday, a bipartisan Texas bill that eliminates sales taxes on menstrual products went into effect, making it the 24th state in the country, as well as District of Columbia, to remove what is colloquially known as the “tampon tax.”"
Hawaii,Q3,"In the United States, smoke from wildfires is undoing progress from the Clean Air Act. In poorer countries, the situation is even worse. On the heels of an exceptionally fiery and smoky summer, two new reports released Wednesday confirmed what many Americans have been already seeing and breathing."
Hawaii,Q3,"The primary drug used to treat the sexually transmitted infection could be scarce into next year, Pfizer warns. A new shortage of a type of penicillin crucial to the fight against syphilis is alarming infectious disease experts, who warn that a protracted scarcity of the drug could worsen the U.S. epidemic of the sexually transmitted infection."
Hawaii,Q3,"Algorithmic recommendations aren’t just bad for kids’ mental health; they’re taking away the journey of discovery that comes with being human. Kids are even more in the bag of social media companies than we think. So many of them have ceded their online autonomy so fully to their phones that they even balk at the idea of searching the internet — for them, the only acceptable online environment is one customized by big tech algorithms, which feed them customized content."

Hawaii,Q3,"A new scientific report offers the most exhaustive look yet at how nonnative plants and animals can drive extinctions, disrupt food systems and harm human health. Thousands of invasive species introduced to new ecosystems around the world are causing more than $423 billion in estimated losses to the global economy every year by harming nature, damaging food systems and threatening human health, a wide-ranging scientific report published on Monday has found."
Hawaii,Q3,"Avian species are “especially vulnerable,” scientists say. The Maui wildfires are an ongoing human tragedy. At least 111 people have died, more than 1,000 people are unaccounted for, and many have been displaced from their homes."
Hawaii,Q3,A judge found there was “a fundamental constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.” The state of Montana has a constitutional obligation to protect its residents from climate change.
Hawaii,Q3,"An essential American art form reaches a milestone. For 50 years, the essential writing — fables, comedies, diaries; adventure, memoir, porn — about young Black life in this country has been happening in hip-hop. Songs about feelings, fantasies, dilemmas, confessions, fantasias. What else is Notorious B.I.G.’s “Ready to Die” and its grueling, knowing, melodic re-creation of moral decay and sexual congress other than a triumph of literature? It is but one title on a shelf buckling with scores of comparable powerhouses. That’s one masterpiece set in New York."
Hawaii,Q3,"It isn’t every generation that produces a president who is charged with 91 counts by two local D.A.s and one special counsel. Bret Stephens: Before we get to Donald Trump’s indictment in Georgia or the upcoming G.O.P. debate, I want to take note of the appalling tragedy in Hawaii. The images from Maui are just heartbreaking. But I also get a sense that heartbreak will soon turn to outrage as we learn more about the cascade of policy failures that led to the disaster."
Hawaii,Q3,"Also, a new biography of Elon Musk. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. The F.D.A. gave the green light today to a new round of Covid boosters, the first to be approved since the public health emergency ended in May. The move comes as the Biden administration is preparing a campaign to convince Americans to get immunized, and as Covid cases tick up."
Hawaii,Q3,"Plus, the U.S. reached a deal with Iran to free Americans. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. President Biden issued a major disaster declaration for Maui as evacuation centers filled and tourists fled from the island in the wake of a fast-moving wildfire. The death toll climbed to 36, and hundreds of buildings were damaged in the tourist town of Lahaina and elsewhere on the western coast."
Hawaii,Q3,"Indictments and debate drama ensure that the primary revolves around him. There was a time, not all that long ago, when being indicted was bad for a politician’s career. That time is over — at least for Donald Trump."
Hawaii,Q3,"The state’s Covid-19 positivity rate is the highest it’s been since January, but experts say that isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. If you’re anything like me, Covid-19 hasn’t been on your mind much lately."
Hawaii,Q3,"As Dianne Feinstein, 90, struggles to function in the Senate, a dispute within her family over control of her late husband’s estate is another difficult chapter at the end of a long career. For years, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has been engaged in a long and painful public drama about her health and ability to do her job, as she winds down a storied career as a lawmaker and a former mayor of San Francisco."
Hawaii,Q3,"Making a few tweaks to your fitness habits — and mind-set — as you hit middle age can set you up for long-term mobility with less pain. Getting older doesn’t have to mean moving less. The key to longstanding fitness, experts say, is envisioning the kind of athlete you want to be 20, 30, even 40 years from now, and training smartly in the present for that future."
Hawaii,Q3,"The Los Angeles landmark turns 100 this year. This summer, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum turned 100."
Hawaii,Q3,"Donald Trump’s response to another criminal indictment. Donald Trump has 10 days to turn himself in, as he faces accusations that he and 18 other people orchestrated a “criminal enterprise” to reverse the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. The sweeping charges, which were brought on Monday night by a local prosecutor in Atlanta, fall under the state’s racketeering statute, which was originally designed to dismantle organized crime groups."

Hawaii,Q3,"Also, Hilary’s impact in Southern California. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. President Biden landed this evening in Hawaii, where he planned to inspect the damage wrought by the wildfires that killed more than 100 people and effectively wiped out a coastal town on the island of Maui nearly two weeks ago. "
Hawaii,Q3,"The upstart Republican candidate has made inaccurate claims about climate change as well as the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, while mischaracterizing his own positions and past comments. Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and author, commanded considerable attention during the first Republican primary debate as his standing was rising in national polls."
Hawaii,Q3,The court found that young people have a constitutional right to a healthful environment and that the state must consider potential climate damage when approving projects. A group of young people in Montana won a landmark lawsuit on Monday when a judge ruled that the state’s failure to consider climate change when approving fossil fuel projects was unconstitutional.
Hawaii,Q3,"As federal agencies prepare to enact their contingency plans for a shutdown, this is where the public could notice changes in the coming days. Washington braced for a government shutdown over the weekend as Congress remained mired in dysfunction on Friday. Federal agencies planned to send home hundreds of thousands of workers, who would not be paid until the shutdown ended. Hundreds of thousands of others deemed essential, like air traffic controllers, would be ordered to work. They, too, would not be paid until Congress reached a deal."
Hawaii,Q3,"Jennifer Lee and Dr. Sachin Jain bonded over commonalities in their upbringings. They also discovered, after separate car accidents, that they could count on each other. While driving home from a work dinner in downtown Los Angeles in August 2021, Jennifer Lee’s Toyota Prius was suddenly struck in the side by another car that had run a red light. Ms. Lee had suffered whiplash, her car was badly damaged and she was in a state of shock."
Hawaii,Q3,"The lawsuit, filed by the county district attorney, is the latest sign of frustrations over tent encampments in the state. The City of Sacramento was sued on Tuesday by the top prosecutor of the surrounding county, who said that California’s capital had suffered an “utter collapse into chaos” because city authorities were not doing enough to remove homeless people from the streets."
Hawaii,Q3,"An agreement between Senate Republicans and Democrats would keep agencies open through mid-November and provide billions in aid for Ukraine and disaster relief. But House Republicans are likely to balk. Senate Republicans and Democrats reached agreement on Tuesday on a stopgap spending plan that would head off a government shutdown on Sunday while providing billions in disaster relief and aid to Ukraine, but the measure faced resistance in the Republican-led House."
Hawaii,Q3,"Plus how rap is written today. The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, convened a special summit yesterday in New York designed to shine a spotlight on the most ambitious global leaders on climate policy. The leaders of the U.S. and China, the world’s biggest polluters, did not get a turn at the microphone."
Hawaii,Q3,"Recovery efforts in Morocco. For days after a deadly earthquake left their village in rubble, the people of Douar Tnirt, a remote village in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains, were left alone to dig out and bury victims. Officials and emergency responders were nowhere in sight."
Hawaii,Q3,59 percent of voters sided with young activists in a referendum. Ecuador voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to halt oil drilling in one of the most biodiverse places on earth.
Hawaii,Q3,"The toll of devastating wildfires in Maui. A summer of ferocious weather across much of the U.S. has now yielded the nation’s deadliest wildfire in more than a century.

Hawaii,Q3,"Plus, the Australia vs. England semifinal at the World Cup.

Hawaii,Q3,"Also, the Women’s World Cup final. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. The National Hurricane Center issued its first-ever tropical-storm watch for Southern California today as Hurricane Hilary, a large and powerful Category 4 storm, barreled toward the region."
Hawaii,Q3,"More than 120 business leaders, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, are urging President Biden and congressional leaders to provide aid to the city. As New York City’s migrant crisis continues to escalate, with more than 100,000 arrivals from the southern U.S. border straining shelters, some of the city’s top business leaders are intervening in a fight over who’s responsible."
Hawaii,Q3,"How climate change and the resulting calamities are killing our notion of the hallowed sun-seeking summer vacation. The images emerging from the Mediterranean in late July resembled a fixture of the evening news: the desperate crowd fleeing adversity. But these fugitives walking along hot tarmac or waiting to board rescue boats in the night were not the displaced victims of a broken republic. These were pleasure seekers in flip-flops and tank tops, toting beach bags over sun-tanned shoulders, retreating from a glowing sky."
Hawaii,Q3,"A deadly boat accident off Cape Verde. More than 60 people are believed to have died after a boat carrying them from Senegal capsized in the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Verde, the authorities said this week. A Spanish fisherman found the boat floating about 150 miles north of Sal, one of the islands that make up Cape Verde, according to the country’s national police."
Hawaii,Q3,"Also, the first Republican debate is tonight. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday.

Hawaii,Q3,"Participants in The New York Times Climate Forward event sum up their views on the response to the crisis — and the challenges for young people. The urgent need to address the conditions that are causing climate change — and to lessen the impact as temperatures climb and environmental catastrophes mount — has drawn widespread engagement from governments, politicians, industries, scientists, advocacy groups and concerned citizens. Leaders from many of the fields will be speaking, presenting and discussing their efforts at The New York Times Climate Forward event in New York on Thursday. We asked a sampling of participants to reply in advance to three questions about the state of the response to the environmental challenges. Their answers, which have been edited and condensed, are included here."
Hawaii,Q3,"The couple were wed Sept. 8 in an intimate ceremony at their home in Farmington, Conn. The newlyweds spoke to The New York Times in an exclusive interview about their relationship. On a recent Thursday morning, after ABC’s “Good Morning America” had finished its broadcast, Robin Rene Roberts and Amber Laign sat in the corner table of a restaurant a couple hundred feet away from the studio."
Hawaii,Q4,"Plus Vegemite’s 100th birthday. The Palestinian Red Crescent said yesterday that Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City was “no longer operational,” as power outages and shortages of fuel continued to wreak havoc on Gaza’s health facilities. The Gazan aid group said that more than 14,000 displaced people had been sheltering there."
Hawaii,Q4,"That might not be great for the long-term financial health of the country. If there is a war of the generations, we older Americans are winning it. As evidence, I present two remarkable charts, which are my versions of charts made by the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging at the University of California, Berkeley."
Hawaii,Q4,"A form of worship constantly on display. HBO’s three-part docuseries “Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God” begins with sirens and a scream. Grainy bodycam footage captures police officers making their way through a small Colorado house to a bedroom decorated with colored string lights shaped like flowers. On the bed is a body covered by a sleeping bag. Only a face is visible. The skin is blue and the eyes are missing, their sockets surrounded by glitter. Documentaries about cults don’t often end on a high note, but few start with the leader decomposing in her own bed, surrounded by twinkle lights. "
Hawaii,Q4,"Dr. Connor Bowman was charged with murder after investigators found that his wife, Betty Bowman, was poisoned with a drug that he had researched online. A Minnesota doctor who the authorities said had worked as a poison specialist was arrested on Friday and charged in the death of his wife, Betty Bowman, who died in August from poisoning."
Hawaii,Q4,"The latest from the war in Gaza. Patients including babies at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza are dying because of a lack of power, medical staff said amid conflicting accounts from Israel and health authorities in Gaza over why a badly needed fuel delivery for the besieged and crumbling facility had been held up."
Hawaii,Q4,"Joseph Emerson, charged with attempted murder, said he felt trapped in a dream after taking mushrooms. He had feared mental health treatments that could disrupt his career. In the minutes before he boarded an Alaska Airlines flight home last month, Joseph Emerson, a pilot for the airline, texted his wife. He was eager to be home with their two young children and longing to be next to her. “I just want to hold you,” he wrote."
Hawaii,Q4,"Plus, food trends in 2024 Ukraine said today it had destroyed the Russian warship Novocherkassk in Crimea, one of the most significant attacks against Moscow’s Black Sea Fleet in months. But in a setback, Ukraine acknowledged that it had largely retreated from the eastern city of Marinka after a monthslong battle."
Hawaii,Q4,How the justices overturned Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court deliberates in secret. Insiders who speak can be cast out of the fold. Learning about the justices’ internal debates over cases can require decades-long waits for their papers to become public.
Hawaii,Q4,Plus Vietnam’s many cable cars. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepened yesterday as Israel said it had conducted “wide-scale” strikes and again warned residents in Gaza to flee south ahead of a possible invasion. 
Hawaii,Q4,"She helped propel Jimmy Carter from rural Georgia to the White House and became the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. Rosalynn Carter, a true life partner to Jimmy Carter who helped propel him from rural Georgia to the White House in a single decade and became the most politically active first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, died on Sunday in Plains, Ga. She was 96. "
Hawaii,Q4,"A new reality competition based on the violent Korean hit features 456 players vying for a $4.56 million prize. Player 450, dressed in a green and white tracksuit, lunged forward, rushing to reach the finish line. Suddenly, the head of a gigantic doll swiveled around and she froze, but it was too late. She crumpled to the ground."
Hawaii,Q4,"Medical scientists and the military are looking into whether Robert Card’s psychological collapse was linked to brain damage from his role as a grenade instructor. After a 40-year-old Army Reservist named Robert Card went on a shooting spree in Lewiston, Maine, in October, his community grasped for answers."
Hawaii,Q4,"Dismissive comments by the president of the climate gathering raise questions about the host country’s commitment to addressing rising global temperatures. Tensions are rising on Monday over contentious comments by Sultan Ahmed al Jaber, the oil executive and Emirati politician presiding over the COP28 climate summit."
Hawaii,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Hawaii,Q4,"Plus a dance protest craze spreads in Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel vowed to “fight to the end” in Gaza as anguish continued to spread over the killings of three hostages last week. The hostages were accidentally shot by the Israeli military as they were waving a white flag, and their deaths have raised new questions about how Netanyahu’s government is prosecuting the war."
Hawaii,Q4,"We look at the evidence for who is responsible. Last month, a few days after the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, I walked you through the debate over who was responsible. At the time, there wasn’t much evidence that outsiders could assess on their own. The dispute revolved around competing claims from Israel and Hamas."
Hawaii,Q4,We highlight some of the best work from news outlets across the U.S. Many of this country’s biggest problems are devilishly hard to solve. The decline of local news may be different.
Hawaii,Q4,"Former President Jimmy Carter emerged from hospice care to join a cast of political heavyweights paying tribute to Mrs. Carter, who died at 96 last week at her home in Plains, Ga. Her journey took her from the smallest of small towns in rural Georgia to the majesty of the White House, from the campaign trails of Iowa and New Hampshire to refugee camps in Asia and impoverished villages in Africa."
Hawaii,Q4,"It started with a bout of dry, itchy skin. Soon everything hurt. A specialist found a way to find some relief. The 49-year-old woman knew as soon as she got out of bed that something was very wrong. A quick survey of her body revealed the source: Sprinkled around her bellybutton were a half dozen blisters. They were small — the largest maybe the size of a pencil eraser — and painful. They looked like the kind of blister you might get on your heel after wearing a new pair of shoes. Except they were on her belly. "
Hawaii,Q4,"The singer has released a 1,000-page memoir. Its heart is a story of perseverance. This year’s memoirs have kept ravenous consumers of celebrity culture well fed. "

Hawaii,Q4,"American spy agencies have warned about the Emirati firm G42 and its work with large Chinese companies that U.S. officials consider security threats. When the secretive national security adviser of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, visited the White House in June, his American counterpart, Jake Sullivan, raised a delicate issue: G42, an artificial intelligence firm controlled by the sheikh that American officials believe is hiding the extent of its work with China."
Hawaii,Q4,"This year’s Super Mega has 769 clues. This year’s Puzzle Mania features a 50 by 50 grid with TK entries. While the print issue provides a slip sheet with all the clues, we’ve reproduced it in digital form in case you lose it or want another way to solve. We suggest ctrl + f the number of the clue and A. or D. for across and down, respectively."
Hawaii,Q4,"The largest trees on the planet can’t easily ‘migrate’ — but in a warming world, some humans are helping them try to find new homes. When Philip Stielstra retired from Boeing in 2012, he needed something purposeful to do. He and his wife, Gay, were casual golfers, but Stielstra, an antiwar activist in college who refused to fight in Vietnam — he worked in a post office instead — wanted a pastime with bigger stakes. Before leaving his job, he received an email from the city of Seattle: The Parks and Recreation Department needed “tree ambassadors.” Tree canopy cover had receded in the city, and the department was responding by promoting an appreciation for its remaining trees. The volunteer ambassadors would learn about these trees and lead residents on walking tours to marvel at them. Stielstra, despite being a self-described introvert, signed up. "

Idaho,Q1,"The legislative calendar is packed with 300 abortion bills. “You can’t go to jail for screwing up an appendectomy,” one lawmaker said. For the first time since the fight over abortion access was kicked to the states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, newly elected legislatures around the country are coming into session and are putting the polarizing issue at the top of their agendas. Around 300 bills in 40 states have been proposed so far — with a majority seeking to restrict access to abortion, and others trying to strengthen it."
Idaho,Q1,"Menopause has long been a taboo topic. Talking about it can help women learn more about an overlooked treatment. Menopause, for many women, is an unknown — a confusing tunnel to pass through, with limited signage for what to expect."
Idaho,Q1,"Sexually explicit content has become so prevalent online that teenagers are deluged, according to a new report by a nonprofit child advocacy group. The internet has transformed pornography, making it much easier to view and share than in the days of Playboy magazine and late-night cable television."
Idaho,Q1,"He followed his father, Evel Knievel, into the high-flying world of motorcycle stunts, jumping the Grand Canyon and the fountains at Caesars Palace. Robbie Knievel, a daredevil performer who soared into the sky on motorcycles, pulling off a series of spectacular airborne stunts like his father, Evel Knievel, died on Friday at his home in Reno, Nev. He was 60."
Idaho,Q1,"House Republicans are struggling with a test of governing. The vote for House speaker is the kind of government procedure that Americans often ignore, but yesterday’s highly unusual votes have important implications for the future of the Republican Party and how it will govern."
Idaho,Q1,"The president has found a welcome foil in a new conservative House majority and its tax and spending plans, sharpening a potential re-election message. WASHINGTON — President Biden on Thursday assailed House Republicans over their tax and spending plans, including potential changes to popular retirement programs, ahead of what is likely to be a run for re-election."
Idaho,Q1,"Five articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."
Idaho,Q1,"What do you notice and wonder about the intensity, peak and duration of respiratory illnesses in the U.S.? This graph shows the prior and current trends in the United States for respiratory illness — including Covid, flu and R.S.V. (respiratory syncytial virus). R.S.V. is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. For the 2022-23 season, the most recent week of data included in the graph ends on Nov. 26. "
Idaho,Q1,"One generation’s impact on the work force. The U.S. job market has staged a remarkable rebound since the start of the pandemic almost three years ago. The latest government data, released on Friday, showed that 2022 was the second-best year on record in terms of raw job growth, behind only 2021."
Idaho,Q1,"Develop stronger relationships in 2023. For over 80 years, researchers at Harvard have studied what makes for a good life. They found one surefire, scientifically proven predictor of happiness: developing warmer relationships."
Idaho,Q1,"The F.B.I. says a gallery owner made up medical emergencies, including a double lung transplant and a coma, as part of a criminal scheme to swindle older collectors. As J. Ross Baughman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, prepared to downsize into a new apartment in 2020, he realized he would not have the wall space for his entire collection, which included prints by marquee names like Diane Arbus and Richard Avedon."
Idaho,Q1,"G.O.P. elites are simply lagging their states. My whole adult life, the work of fighting climate change was understood as the job of the blue team in America. The red team, we knew, just wasn’t going to play ball."

President Biden delivered his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress. The following is a transcript of his remarks, as recorded by The New York Times."
Idaho,Q1,"Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind. The 2023 tax filing season is probably most notable for what’s missing: After three years of stimulus payments and pandemic tax breaks, nearly all of those extra benefits have faded away — and tax refunds are likely to shrink as a result."
Idaho,Q1,"What happened to a state known for its political independence? The fifth season of the hit show “Yellowstone” premiered on the Sunday after the midterm elections, with Kevin Costner’s character, the rancher John Dutton, assuming Montana’s governorship. “This was never my plan,” he says, wearing a cowboy hat outside the State Capitol building in Helena. Dutton has reluctantly entered politics in part to stop an influx of rich outsiders he believes are transforming his home. In the last three years, Montana has become the second-fastest-growing state in the nation, largely because of the arrival of wealthy transplants. Unlike Dutton, many influential figures in the state’s real Republican Party have welcomed them, sometimes calling them “political refugees” fleeing blue states. Montana’s actual governor, the Republican Greg Gianforte, is himself a multimillionaire who was raised in Pennsylvania. Since assuming office in 2021, Gianforte has presided over this period of demographic change and economic growth, which has coincided with a hard shift to the right in state politics."
Idaho,Q1,"To fix a problem like homelessness in America, you need to know its scope. To do that, you need sheriffs, social workers, volunteers, flashlights and 10 days in January. They go into the streets in search of data. Peeking behind dumpsters, shining flashlights under bridges, rustling a frosted tent to see if anyone was inside. This is what it takes to count the people in America who don’t have a place to live. To get a number, however flawed, that describes the scope of a deeply entrenched problem and the country’s progress toward fixing it."
Idaho,Q1,"Her father doubted her much of her career. Les Moonves launched a bid at CBS to overrule her. That was before sexual misconduct allegations came to light. Now Shari Redstone controls the media empire. On Sunday, May 13, 2018, Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, faced a difficult decision, perhaps the most agonizing of his long and celebrated media career: whether to pull the trigger on a coup against the Redstone family, which controlled CBS."
Idaho,Q1,"Anti-trans legislation in dozens of states is an attack on parental rights. JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Russel Neiss glanced down at his Apple Watch. The screen glowed bright red, warning of something he already knew: Though he was sitting stock still, waiting to testify before state senators, his heart was hammering."
Idaho,Q1,"Corrections that appeared in print on Wednesday, March 8, 2023. An article on Tuesday about a move by Senator Bernie Sanders to subpoena Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, misstated the number of complaints and unfair labor practice charges that the National Labor Relations Board has received against Starbucks. It was 81 complaints and 504 unfair labor practice charges, not 504 complaints and 81 charges."

Idaho,Q1,
Idaho,Q1,
Idaho,Q2,"Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature prioritized a number of measures restricting transgender rights during this year’s session that ended on Friday. The Florida Legislature passed a bill on Thursday that would prohibit gender-transition care for minors and restrict it for adults, one of several measures aimed at L.G.B.T.Q. communities that have been passed during this year’s legislative session. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican crisscrossing the country as he tests a possible 2024 presidential run, is expected to sign it into law."
Idaho,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Idaho,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors. Ten states in the past three months have passed laws prohibiting what is known as gender-affirming care for young people, in a rapid effort by Republican lawmakers across the country."
Idaho,Q2,"A requirement that states keep people on Medicaid during the coronavirus pandemic has come to an end, and 15 million people could lose their coverage as a result. KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In a closet-sized windowless office, Kialah Marshall maintains an Excel spreadsheet with a prosaic title, “Medicaid Unwinding,” the source material for a mind-numbing routine."
Idaho,Q2,"The court split 3-3 on whether to revive a much stricter six-week limit, enacted in 2018, that was struck down before Roe v. Wade was overturned. A legal attempt to ban abortion in Iowa after six weeks of pregnancy failed on Friday, after the State Supreme Court deadlocked over whether to vacate a lower court’s injunction and allow the ban to take effect. That means abortion will remain legal in Iowa through 20 weeks of pregnancy."
Idaho,Q2,For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted. For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted.
Idaho,Q2,"Republican lawmakers in the state, frustrated and powerless, have in recent years turned repeatedly to the disruptive tactic to stall bills. Frustrated, powerless and with little hope of regaining significant influence anytime soon, Republican lawmakers in Oregon have in recent years turned repeatedly to a disruptive tactic: boycotting their own legislature."
Idaho,Q2,"Temperatures will be up to 20 degrees above normal for much of the region through at least the weekend, with no nighttime relief. Even for Southerners used to spending a lot of time outside, this week’s brutal heat and humidity — which spread from Texas across the Gulf Coast and north into Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas on Wednesday — are a little much."
Idaho,Q2,"In the campaign to ban gender therapies for minors, Republicans have amplified a group of activists who no longer identify as transgender, overriding objections from transgender people and medical experts. When Missouri lawmakers took up bills to ban transition care for minors, Chloe Cole, an activist from California, traveled to Jefferson City to offer her story as Exhibit A."
Idaho,Q2,"In lawsuits challenging state abortion bans, lawyers for abortion rights plaintiffs are employing religious liberty arguments the Christian right has used for decades. For years, conservative Christians have used the principle of religious freedom to prevail in legal battles on issues like contraceptive insurance mandates and pandemic restrictions. Now, abortion rights supporters are employing that argument to challenge one of the right’s most prized accomplishments: state bans on abortion."
Idaho,Q2,"If you fell asleep on the big night, don’t worry. So did many other (still) happily married couples. Emily Lynen, 29, and Amber Lynen, 35, had every intention of having sex on their wedding night."
Idaho,Q2,"Summer technically just began, and parts of the U.S. already have dangerous heat. Today, New Orleans will reach 113 degrees in the heat index. Houston will reach 111. Mobile, Ala., and Jackson, Miss., will also surpass 110. And those are only a few of the places that will experience dangerous heat this week."
Idaho,Q2,"The organized movement to ban books in schools is betraying the young people it claims to protect. Last year, a parent at a Virginia school board meeting stepped up to a microphone and read a passage from my book, “Sold.” The scene she chose to read, informed in part by my own experiences of sexual abuse, describes the sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl by an older man. There is no graphic language or obscenity in the passage; the story is told from the point of view of a child — in the words of a child — and conveys her confusion, terror and physical pain."
Idaho,Q2,"The proposed debt cancellation of more than $400 billion would have been one of the most expensive executive actions in U.S. history. The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority with its plan to wipe out more than $400 billion in student debt, dashing the hopes of tens of millions of borrowers and imposing new restrictions on presidential power."
Idaho,Q2,"Democrats are vowing to make abortion rights a pillar of their campaigns, while Republicans are caught between their conservative base and a public that generally backs access to the procedure. Nearly a year after the Supreme Court turned abortion into a dominant issue of the 2022 midterms, the battle over abortion rights has catapulted to the center of the emerging 2024 election season, igniting Democrats, dividing Republicans and turbocharging sensitive debates over health care."
Idaho,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Idaho,Q2,"A federal judge in Washington State issued a ruling ordering the Food and Drug Administration to make no changes to the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone on Friday, directly contradicting another judge’s ruling in a legal standoff likely to escalate to the Supreme Court.

Idaho,Q2,"Melissa Kirsch takes a look at some of the big books coming this summer. The books are piling up again. The physical ones on the bedside table; the library queue; the e-bookshelves on which reside the novels impulse-purchased from bed, begun and then forgotten in one insomniac night. My eyes, always, bigger than my attention span."
Idaho,Q2,"They rarely give on-the-record interviews. Only two are on Twitter. But they will be the main force behind the president’s political strategy. When President Biden announced his re-election campaign and its top two staff members this week, the names of his closest and longest-serving advisers were not included."
Idaho,Q2,"As DeSantis announces his campaign, we dig into what may be the single most important fact about U.S. politics. If Ronald Reagan were to come back to life, he would probably be confused by the leftist tone that the early 2024 Republican presidential campaign has sometimes taken."
Idaho,Q2,"In his new video installation, the artist known for maximalist works like “The Cremaster Cycle” returns to the football fields of his childhood. The hit, 45 years ago, shook up the world of football. Then, just as quickly, people moved on. But not Darryl Stingley, the receiver for the New England Patriots who bore the head-on charge by Jack Tatum of the Oakland Raiders. Stingley was rendered quadriplegic. Tatum, a defender known as “The Assassin,” notoriously never apologized."
Idaho,Q2,"What should we make of the role that abortion played in both the Chicago and Wisconsin elections this week? The elections this week in Chicago and Wisconsin were different in many ways. One was for mayor, the other for a state Supreme Court seat. One was in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, the other in a closely divided swing state."
Idaho,Q2,"Many of the bills denied certain medical care to transgender people, while others targeted bathroom use and preferred personal pronouns. Statehouses around the country this year have been consumed by fights over laws governing transgender people."
Idaho,Q2,"A $528 billion plan to clean up 54 million gallons of radioactive bomb-making waste may never be achieved. Government negotiators are looking for a compromise. From 1950 to 1990, the U.S. Energy Department produced an average of four nuclear bombs every day, turning them out of hastily built factories with few environmental safeguards that left behind a vast legacy of toxic radioactive waste."
Idaho,Q2,"With a fortune made in real estate, he went into the media business in a landmark leveraged buyout of the Tribune Company in 2007. Bankruptcy ensued. Sam Zell, the real estate tycoon who specialized in distressed assets and acquired The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and other storied but troubled newspapers in a widely criticized leveraged buyout of the parent Tribune Company in 2007, died on Thursday. He was 81."
Idaho,Q2,"A federal judge in Texas issued a preliminary ruling invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s 23-year-old approval of the abortion pill mifepristone on Friday, clashing with another court’s ruling in a legal standoff likely to escalate to the Supreme Court.

Idaho,Q3,"How hot is it? No single temperature reading can capture the nation’s misery, so we’ve assembled a lot of figures to put the oppressive heat in context. All signs indicate that this will be one of the hottest summers on record, as a heat wave scorches the Northern Hemisphere. Large portions of the United States are sweating through oppressive conditions that show no signs of easing, accompanied by a growing death toll."

Idaho,Q3,The attack on bodily autonomy is an assault on both political equality and reproductive freedom. There is no way to regulate and control pregnancy without regulating and controlling people. States that have enacted abortion bans in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization have also considered the establishment of regimes for the surveillance and criminalization of anyone who dares to circumvent the state’s dictates for the acceptable use of one’s body.
Idaho,Q3,"What’s behind the shift in the Democratic Party’s economic policy? Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both ran for president promising to reinvigorate the economy for ordinary Americans. And both enacted laws that helped millions of people. Clinton expanded children’s health care and tax credits for low-income families. Obama accomplished even more, making it possible for almost anybody to afford health insurance."
Idaho,Q3,"He was a founding member of the band, which broke out in the late 1990s with hit songs like “Walkin’ on the Sun” and “All Star.” Steve Harwell, the former lead singer of the rock band Smash Mouth, which was best known for its 1999 hit “All Star,” died on Monday. He was 56."
Idaho,Q3,"Obtaining reasonable accommodations is often a messy, frustrating process for both employees and their managers. But there are solutions. In the summer of 2015, Katherine Macfarlane was preparing to teach at the University of Idaho’s law school. It was her first teaching job on a tenure track, and she wanted to make sure she had everything she needed. So she submitted a request for a keyboard tray and a few other office items."
Idaho,Q3,A product made from umbilical cord blood was used in spine surgeries at a Manhattan hospital. After a federal warning came an internal complaint: Patients should have been told. A visiting researcher at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center was startled when he read the warning from the Food and Drug Administration about a product that had been used in spine surgeries at the esteemed Manhattan hospital.
Idaho,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated. In the wake of the decision, 15 largely conservative states imposed near-total bans (through trigger laws or new legislation), and two more set limits at six weeks of pregnancy. "
Idaho,Q3,"Also, the U.S. gives Ukraine cluster munitions. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. U.S. employers added 209,000 jobs in June, which was the 30th consecutive month of job growth, according to data released today. The gains, however, were the slowest in a two-and-a-half-year streak of growth."
Idaho,Q3,"If being alive right now sometimes feels like standing on a cliff, I want to be with someone who’s not afraid to peer at the frothing tides. The day that wildfire smoke triggered the fire alarms in our Portland, Ore., apartment, I looked at my then-boyfriend and decided I could marry him. He was packing a go bag in case a fire reached our house and we would have to evacuate. With global warming and drought exacerbating wildfires, more than one out of 10 Oregonians had already been displaced or was at risk of having to evacuate from burns around the state. My partner was preparing for the worst. This made me feel safe."
Idaho,Q3,"The Teamsters and management have surprisingly strong ties. Every intense relationship has frictions, and the one between the Teamsters union and United Parcel Service is no exception. Negotiations have broken down in the final stage of talks on a five-year contract, with the Teamsters vowing to strike if a new contract isn’t ratified by the time the current one expires on July 31. Each side has accused the other of walking away from the bargaining table."
Idaho,Q3,"Virtual fencing has the potential to make a sweeping impact on the American West’s inhabitants, human and animal alike. “Wherever a farm may be located, or whatever may be its production, fence, fence, fence is the first, the intermediate and the last consideration,” the farmer and journalist Sereno Edwards Todd wrote in 1860. Fences keep livestock in and predators out, and both were imperative for the settlers drawn to the Great Plains by the government’s promises of free land. But on the Plains in the mid-19th century, newcomers found that timber was scarce, stone walls were impractical and living fences, usually thorny hedges of Osage orange, took years to grow."

Idaho,Q3,"An immigrant story, an American dream, a machine that defined bourgeois sensuality. Candido Jacuzzi didn’t set out to turn his last name into a global brand. Nor did he intend to power a business which, though it created the family fortune, nearly tore them apart. He just wanted to ease the physical pain suffered by his son, any way he could."
Idaho,Q3,"They served in Congress and on the N.R.A.’s board at the same time. Over decades, a small group of legislators led by a prominent Democrat pushed the gun lobby to help transform the law, the courts and views on the Second Amendment. Long before the National Rifle Association tightened its grip on Congress, won over the Supreme Court and prescribed more guns as a solution to gun violence — before all that, Representative John D. Dingell Jr. had a plan."

Idaho,Q4,"Ohio’s governor reminds Republicans that they’re supposed to support parents’ rights, even if their children are trans. As 2023 slouches to an ignominious end, some news came Friday that gave me an unexpected jolt of hope. I have spent much of the year watching with horror and trying to document an unrelenting legal assault on queer and trans people. Around 20 states have passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans and nonbinary people, and several have barred transgender and nonbinary people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity."
Idaho,Q4,"Scientists doing “gain-of-function” research said that heightened fears of lab leaks are stalling studies that could thwart the next pandemic virus. Questions about whether Covid leaked from a Chinese laboratory have cast a chill over American virus research, drying up funding for scientists who collect or alter dangerous pathogens and intensifying a debate over those practices."
Idaho,Q4,"A lower court is now expected to hear arguments on the broader question of whether the right to privacy in the state constitution protects a right to abortion. Georgia’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition of abortion Tuesday, rejecting arguments made by doctors and advocacy groups that the law was unconstitutional when the state legislature approved it in 2019, more than three years before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade."
Idaho,Q4,"Tensions hung over a trade summit in Johannesburg after the Biden administration suspended four African countries that had belonged to a program aimed at promoting economic development. As the United States seeks to deepen its relationships with African nations and counter the influence of rivals like Russia and China, it confronts a tricky question: How does it respond when countries do things that run afoul of Washington’s stated commitment to democracy and human rights?"

Here is the full list of those invited as provided by the White House."
Idaho,Q4,"Many U.S. troops who fired vast numbers of artillery rounds against the Islamic State developed mysterious, life-shattering mental and physical problems. But the military struggled to understand what was wrong. When Javier Ortiz came home from a secret mission in Syria, the ghost of a dead girl appeared to him in his kitchen. She was pale and covered in chalky dust, as if hit by an explosion, and her eyes stared at him with a glare as dark and heavy as oil."
Idaho,Q4,"The largest trees on the planet can’t easily ‘migrate’ — but in a warming world, some humans are helping them try to find new homes. When Philip Stielstra retired from Boeing in 2012, he needed something purposeful to do. He and his wife, Gay, were casual golfers, but Stielstra, an antiwar activist in college who refused to fight in Vietnam — he worked in a post office instead — wanted a pastime with bigger stakes. Before leaving his job, he received an email from the city of Seattle: The Parks and Recreation Department needed “tree ambassadors.” Tree canopy cover had receded in the city, and the department was responding by promoting an appreciation for its remaining trees. The volunteer ambassadors would learn about these trees and lead residents on walking tours to marvel at them. Stielstra, despite being a self-described introvert, signed up. "

Illinois,Q1,"Elected in an upset four years ago, Lori Lightfoot is presiding over a bruised city, one wary in particular about crime. CHICAGO — Mayor Lori Lightfoot met recently with two dozen Chicagoans at a campaign event in a plush apartment building in the city’s affluent Lincoln Park neighborhood. Before long, she shifted into the rapid-fire mode that defined her career before City Hall, when she was a federal prosecutor known for her tenacity."
Illinois,Q1,"The suit argues that rules applying to mifepristone unnecessarily limit patients’ access to medication abortion. The attorneys general of a dozen Democratic-controlled states sued the Food and Drug Administration on Friday, asking a judge to remove special restrictions that the federal agency has long applied to the first of two drugs used in medication abortion."
Illinois,Q1,"A new variant of avian influenza appears capable of spreading among mammals, highlighting the need for more proactive surveillance, experts said. Early last October, the mink on a fur farm in Spain suddenly began to fall ill. They stopped eating and began salivating excessively. They became clumsy, started to experience tremors and developed bloody snouts."
Illinois,Q1,"The National Restaurant Association uses mandatory $15 food-safety classes to turn waiters and cooks into unwitting funders of its battle against minimum wage increases. WASHINGTON — For many cooks, waiters and bartenders, it is an annoying entrance fee to the food-service business: Before starting a new job, they pay around $15 to a company called ServSafe for an online class in food safety."

Illinois,Q1,"Departing longtime lawmakers perceive little prospect of orderly business in a divided Congress. They’re taking with them decades of experience in the day-to-day work of keeping the government running. WASHINGTON — Seated in his rapidly emptying office, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, ticked through the frustrations that had piled up in recent years: party leaders devaluing committee work, an institution reluctant to embrace new ideas and unnamed colleagues unwilling to collaborate or brush up on the details of legislation."
Illinois,Q1,"The first-term Democrat, who was released Friday after two days in the hospital, is coping with the lasting effects of a near-fatal stroke last year, and Congress is adapting to accommodate him. WASHINGTON — At Senator John Fetterman’s desk in the Senate chamber, there is a newly installed monitor that rises or lowers, depending on whether he sits or stands, and provides closed captioning so he can follow the proceedings. At the center dais, a custom desk stand has been built to accommodate the same technology for when he takes his shifts presiding over the Senate."
Illinois,Q1,"Chilling details emerged at an arraignment of Lindsay Clancy, accused of strangling her three children. Her lawyer argued she was mentally ill, but prosecutors outlined methodical planning leading to the deaths. DUXBURY, Mass. — Lindsay Clancy lay paralyzed in a hospital bed on Tuesday afternoon, occasionally blinking or shutting her eyes, unable to do anything but listen as lawyers told two narratives about how she had strangled her three children."

Illinois,Q1,"Staff members of Sarasota Memorial Hospital are bewildered by critics who continue to wage a campaign against federal guidelines on Covid treatment. SARASOTA, Fla. — The turmoil at Sarasota Memorial, one of Florida’s largest public hospitals, began last year after three candidates running on a platform of “health freedom” won seats on the nine-member board that oversees the hospital. Board meetings, once sleepy, started drawing hundreds of angry people who, like the new members, denounced the hospital’s treatment protocols for Covid-19."
Illinois,Q1,"The injury to Damar Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills, who collapsed on the field in cardiac arrest, has drawn attention to players who have been hurt early in their careers and now struggle to get help. The beginning of the end of Zeke Motta’s football career came at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis., in December 2013, when he ran downfield to cover a kickoff for the Atlanta Falcons. Two blockers from the Packers slammed him to the ground, and he briefly lost consciousness."
Illinois,Q1,"Some people who have long lived with the disease say they worry about living as a healthy person, while others are concerned about the obstacles to getting treatment. Terry Jackson lives a life dominated by sickle cell disease. The genetic disorder, in which misshapen red cells become wedged in blood vessels, causes him daily bone pain and lower back pain and has sent him to the hospital for pain treatment and life threatening emergencies for five decades. He has frequent transfusions of fresh blood."
Illinois,Q1,"An agreement between attorneys general and major drug distributors increased scrutiny on medications for A.D.H.D., addiction, anxiety and pain. Nearly a year after a sweeping opioid settlement imposed new requirements on the companies that provide medications to pharmacies, patients across the United States are having difficulty obtaining drugs to treat many conditions, including anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and addiction."
Illinois,Q1,"The legislative calendar is packed with 300 abortion bills. “You can’t go to jail for screwing up an appendectomy,” one lawmaker said. For the first time since the fight over abortion access was kicked to the states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, newly elected legislatures around the country are coming into session and are putting the polarizing issue at the top of their agendas. Around 300 bills in 40 states have been proposed so far — with a majority seeking to restrict access to abortion, and others trying to strengthen it."
Illinois,Q1,"Once considered radical, Elyse Resch and Evelyn Tribole’s method of intuitive eating has become the cornerstone of the modern anti-diet movement.

Illinois,Q1,"Hot flashes, sleeplessness, pain during sex: For some of menopause’s worst symptoms, there’s an established treatment. Why aren’t more women offered it? For the past two or three years, many of my friends, women mostly in their early 50s, have found themselves in an unexpected state of suffering. The cause of their suffering was something they had in common, but that did not make it easier for them to figure out what to do about it, even though they knew it was coming: It was menopause."
Illinois,Q1,"Living Carbon, a biotechnology company, hopes its seedlings can help manage climate change. But wider use of its trees may be elusive. On Monday, in a low-lying tract of southern Georgia’s pine belt, a half-dozen workers planted row upon row of twig-like poplar trees."

After popping by a Fred Segal boutique, you meet friends for early mocktails under the trees at San Vicente Bungalows."
Illinois,Q1,"An ordained minister known as the Vaulting Vicar, he was an Olympic gold medal winner and the first athlete to appear on the front of Wheaties boxes. Bob Richards, the only male two-time winner of the Olympic pole vault, who in the 1950s became a hero of American Cold War competition with the Soviet Union and a breakfast-table hero to millions as the first champion on the front of the Wheaties box, died on Sunday at his home in Waco, Texas. He was 97."
Illinois,Q1,"For recipients, it’s a lifeline. For liberal supporters, it shows how expanding government can make a difference. For conservatives, it’s a return to wasteful welfare handouts. CHICAGO — Christopher Ellington’s South Side photography studio crashed in 2020 with the onset of the pandemic. By March 2021, he was scraping by on a tax preparation and financial advice business when gunshots rang out one day as he was leaving work. Two bullets from a drive-by shooter pierced his head and left him permanently blind."
Illinois,Q1,"We choose highlights from events featuring Mitsuko Uchida and Franz Welser-Möst as Perspectives artists, and the composer Tania León in residence.

Illinois,Q1,"She founded the first woman-owned lobbying firm in the country, and made her name by supporting social policy and nonprofit causes. Liz Robbins, who after opening the country’s first woman-owned lobbying firm in 1977 became one of Washington’s most successful and most beloved operators — no easy feat for someone in her profession — died on Saturday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 76."
Illinois,Q1,"Prison officials and judges have been reluctant to support “compassionate releases” unless an inmate is ill, dying or incapacitated by age. WASHINGTON — The Bureau of Prisons has rejected the early release of a female inmate who said she had been sexually abused by male employees at a notorious California penitentiary, reflecting a broader struggle by the Justice Department to free inmates abused in federal custody, when appropriate."
Illinois,Q1,"Thrust into the role of spokesman after the assassination attempt in 1981, he led televised medical briefings that reassured an anxious nation. Dr. Dennis O’Leary, the Washington hospital administrator whose edifying medical briefings, delivered in a calm baritone, reassured a world shocked by the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, died on Jan. 29 in Kansas City, Mo. He was 85."
Illinois,Q1,"Some of the highest-profile complaints show how America’s culture wars are affecting the nation’s children. WASHINGTON — The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights logged a record number of discrimination complaints in the past year, the latest indicator of how the social and political strife roiling the country is reverberating in the nation’s schools."
Illinois,Q1,"Only a tiny fraction of scripted movies and TV shows talk about climate change. Meet the woman trying to change that. Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time, but you wouldn’t know it from watching the Oscars this Sunday."
Illinois,Q1,"Crowded scenes at the border do not necessarily translate into an increase in the undocumented population. Many other immigrants have been returning home. In August 2021, more than three decades after sneaking across the southern border as young adults to work and support their families in Mexico, Irma and Javier Hernandez checked in at La Guardia Airport for a one-way flight from New York to Oaxaca. They were leaving behind four American children, stable jobs where they were valued employees and a country they had grown to love."

Illinois,Q1,"There are so many good reasons to return to hobbies and activities that gave us joy when we were younger, as these reader stories show. "
Illinois,Q1,"Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind. The 2023 tax filing season is probably most notable for what’s missing: After three years of stimulus payments and pandemic tax breaks, nearly all of those extra benefits have faded away — and tax refunds are likely to shrink as a result."
Illinois,Q1,"“I understand that sharing any kind of thoughts can be hard, but if you’re struggling it is so worth it.” When was the last time you shared something really personal with a friend— a problem you were struggling with, an embarrassing moment, a crush you had on someone, or anything else?"
Illinois,Q1," We’re replacing pandemic narratives of enormous complexity with just-so stories. We are entering the fourth year of the pandemic, believe it or not: Freshmen are now seniors, toddlers now kindergartners and medical students now doctors. We’ve completed two American election cycles and one World Cup cycle. Army volunteers are nearing the end of their active-duty commitment. It’s been a long haul but in other ways a short jump: Three years is not so much time that it should be hard to clearly remember what happened. And yet it seems to me, on many important points our conventional pandemic history is already quite smudged."
Illinois,Q1,"In her decades-long political career, Ms. Feinstein led San Francisco in the wake of political assassinations, kept the C.I.A. accountable for torture and held sway over Supreme Court nominations. For generations, she was an iconic American political figure — a leader on issues from the environment to assault-style weapons, the longest-serving senator ever to represent California, the first woman to make it to the top of San Francisco’s political system, catapulted there after a still-shocking burst of gun violence."
Illinois,Q1,The anger felt by rural voters toward the Democratic Party is driving a regional realignment. Rural America has become the Republican Party’s life preserver.
Illinois,Q1,"To fix a problem like homelessness in America, you need to know its scope. To do that, you need sheriffs, social workers, volunteers, flashlights and 10 days in January. They go into the streets in search of data. Peeking behind dumpsters, shining flashlights under bridges, rustling a frosted tent to see if anyone was inside. This is what it takes to count the people in America who don’t have a place to live. To get a number, however flawed, that describes the scope of a deeply entrenched problem and the country’s progress toward fixing it."
Illinois,Q1,"There’s a good chance that the Fed could push the economy into recession. The pain will not be shared equally. Early last October, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, spoke to several dozen graduate students at the University of Minnesota. Federal Reserve officials tend to choose their words with exquisite care. One misstatement or clumsy phrase, even before an audience dressed in shorts and flip-flops, can spook the financial markets. With the Fed, the nation’s central bank, rapidly raising interest rates to combat the highest inflation that the United States had experienced in four decades, Wall Street was especially skittish. But there was little chance of Kashkari’s committing a gaffe: He was a skilled public speaker, an ability that he honed during a failed campaign for governor in California in 2014. He also had a politician’s knack for using easy-to-understand anecdotes to illustrate complicated ideas. "
Illinois,Q1,"Anti-trans legislation in dozens of states is an attack on parental rights. JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Russel Neiss glanced down at his Apple Watch. The screen glowed bright red, warning of something he already knew: Though he was sitting stock still, waiting to testify before state senators, his heart was hammering."

Illinois,Q1,"The same playbook that has notched high returns acquiring things like foreclosed homes and highway rest stops is being tested by a family-oriented franchise. Tiffany Cianci spends most of her days in socks, padding around the fitness studio she operates in Frederick, Md., about an hour outside Washington. Her clients are young: kids ranging from 4 months to 12 years old. They come to learn somersaults, try the monkey bars, sing some songs. (“Little Red Caboose,” complete with a train whistle accompaniment, is one of her favorites.)"

Illinois,Q2,"“Exercise is a basic human need, and its long-term denial may constitute cruel and unusual punishment,” said prison officials, who also asserted three years was tolerable. The case could reach the Supreme Court. WASHINGTON — Michael Johnson, a prisoner in Illinois, suffered from what the corrections system acknowledged was profound mental illness. That made him hard to handle, and prison officials responded by putting him in solitary confinement. Total isolation, in a windowless cell, made things worse."
Illinois,Q2,"Professional athletes and fitness influencers say that timing workouts around their menstrual cycles has big benefits. Experts are less certain. Among the many techniques that helped the U.S. women’s soccer team win the World Cup in 2019 was, according to one of the team’s coaches, a slightly unorthodox strategy: paying attention to the players’ menstrual cycles."
Illinois,Q2,"Washington is considering a ban on the popular app. We asked teenagers what they thought. Their answers may surprise you. TikTok, the social media app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has long worried American lawmakers, but those concerns — which range from national security risks to the app’s effects on young people — came to a fever pitch last month when a House committee voted to advance legislation that would allow President Biden to ban TikTok from all devices nationwide. "
Illinois,Q2,"The monthslong absence of the California Democrat, 89, who was hospitalized for shingles in February, threatened to deprive her party of the votes to advance President Biden’s judicial nominees. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, was returning to Washington on Tuesday evening, her office announced, after a nearly three-month absence from the Senate that threatened to deprive her party of the ability to advance President Biden’s judicial nominees and grind its agenda to a halt in the closely divided chamber."

Illinois,Q2,"Seizing on a powerful motivator for their party, Democratic candidates for municipal offices have put Republicans on their heels. “I’m running for mayor, I’m not debating abortion,” one said. GREEN BAY, Wis. — Eric Genrich is running a full-throated campaign in support of abortion rights, reminding voters of his position at every turn and hammering his anti-abortion opponent in television ads. At a recent event, he featured an obstetrician who now commutes to a state where abortion is legal to treat patients and a local woman who traveled to Colorado to terminate a nonviable pregnancy."
Illinois,Q2,"With the procedure now prohibited in many states, the city is advertising its abortion services in Georgia, Texas and Florida. When Nancy Davis of Baton Rouge, La., learned last summer that the fetus she was carrying had a rare and fatal condition, her anguish was compounded by the chaotic legal terrain surrounding the abortion ban in her state. A local abortion clinic had shut down, and her hospital refused to perform the procedure, despite an exception in Louisiana law for pregnancies deemed “medically futile.”"
Illinois,Q2,"As the Biden administration moves to curb health threats caused by toxic chemicals, the debate hits home for families living near petrochemical plants. Juan López had just returned home from his job supervising the cleaning of giant tanks that hold toxic chemicals produced along the Houston Ship Channel, one of the largest petrochemical complexes in the world."
Illinois,Q2,"The 89-year-old California Democrat, who has been absent from the Senate for more than a month after being diagnosed with shingles, said she would seek a temporary replacement on the powerful committee. WASHINGTON — Senator Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday pushed back on calls for her resignation but asked to step away from the Judiciary Committee indefinitely while recovering from shingles, responding to mounting pressure from Democrats who have publicly vented concerns that she is unable to perform her job."
Illinois,Q2,"The pontiff, giving a public address for the first time since undergoing abdominal surgery, expressed gratitude for the “affection, care and friendship” he had received. Pope Francis prayed with a crowd of thousands in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday, two days after he was discharged from a Rome hospital, giving thanks for the “closeness” he had felt during his hospitalization for abdominal surgery."
Illinois,Q2,"Farmers face an elevated risk of suicide. After Brenda Statz’s husband, Leon, lost his battle with depression, she is trying to spare others from his fate. LOGANVILLE, Wis. — Brenda Statz remembers the rain on the day they lost Leon, her husband of 34 years. The deluge had fallen for weeks, flooding their fields, delaying the harvest, pounding the roof of the barn where Mr. Statz finished his morning chores, then ended his life."
Illinois,Q2,"The Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade has produced some unexpected legal and political changes, as well as a shift in public opinion. In the year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, some of the results of the decision have been unsurprising — more than a dozen Republican-led states have moved to ban most abortions, and dozens of abortion clinics have closed. Yet there have also been unexpected legal and political changes that have left Americans on both sides of the issue scrambling to adapt. Here are five major changes detailed in The New York Times’s coverage of the first anniversary of the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ended the constitutional right to abortion after nearly 50 years."
Illinois,Q2,"Revelations that migrant children have been exploited for cheap labor brought calls for action, but a partisan battle over immigration policy has complicated lawmakers’ efforts. Weeks after revelations that migrant children are being regularly exploited for cheap labor in the United States prompted bipartisan outrage and calls to action on Capitol Hill, Congress has moved no closer to addressing the issue, which has become mired in a long-running partisan war over immigration policy."
Illinois,Q2,"What’s new about the latest version of these Senate holds is the breadth and long-term nature of their effects. Instead of showing up for work last Tuesday, Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, went to Donald Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., to hear the former president rail against his latest criminal indictment. Mr. Tuberville’s absence from the Capitol gave the Senate an opportunity to end his one-man blockade of all military promotions, a campaign he has been waging for four months to protest the Pentagon’s policy paying for service members to travel for an abortion if they live in a state where it is illegal."
Illinois,Q2,"Regulators were scrutinizing the PGA Tour even before its merger with its Saudi-funded competitor. Sports leagues love competition, except against one another. The leagues make more money when they don’t have to compete for talent and audience. That, in a nutshell, seems to explain why the PGA Tour set aside its scruples about doing business with Saudi Arabia and announced on Tuesday that it intended to join forces with the Saudi-funded LIV Golf, an upstart that had paid huge sums to lure away some of the world’s top golfers."
Illinois,Q2,"Chicago residents were warned to stay indoors or wear masks, and the popular paths along Lake Michigan were quiet. Follow our live updates on the Canadian wildfires and air quality. "
Illinois,Q2,"People who deem themselves judge, jury and executioner walk among us, and we have no real way of knowing when they will turn on us. Increasingly, it is not safe to be in public, to be human, to be fallible. I’m not quoting breathless journalism about rising crime or conservative talking points about America falling into ruin. The ruin I’m thinking of isn’t in San Francisco or Chicago or at the southern border. The ruin is woven into the fabric of America. It’s seeping into all of us. All across the country, supposedly good, upstanding citizens are often fatally enforcing ever-changing, arbitrary and personal norms for how we conduct ourselves."
Illinois,Q2,"Lead, bacteria and PFAS are among the contaminants cropping up in drinking water. Over the past few years, water safety crises have cropped up in several cities, including Baltimore, Flint, Mich., Jackson, Miss., and Newark, N.J., where lead or bacteria have leached into tap water, forcing people to rely on bottled water or on boiling their tap water to rid it of pathogens. In New York City, a recent report estimated that one in five people may be drinking lead-contaminated water."
Illinois,Q2,"Ron DeSantis’s presidential bid. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida intends to announce the start of his 2024 presidential campaign this evening in a live conversation on Twitter with Elon Musk, the platform’s owner, moderated by the Republican donor David Sacks. DeSantis will also appear on Fox News in an interview."
Illinois,Q2,"Recent charges, convictions and sentences all indicate that the start-up world’s habit of playing fast and loose with the truth actually has consequences. SAN FRANCISCO — Faking it is over. That’s the feeling in Silicon Valley, along with some schadenfreude and a pinch of paranoia."
Illinois,Q2,"The top U.S. cybersecurity agency said it did not have evidence that the group was acting in coordination with the Russian government. A Russian ransomware group gained access to data from federal agencies, including the Energy Department, in an attack that exploited file transfer software to steal and sell back users’ data, U.S. officials said on Thursday."
Illinois,Q2,"Congress has yet to pass an immigration overhaul, but President Biden has used his executive authority to significantly expand the number of legal immigrants entering the U.S. Amid a protracted stalemate in Congress over immigration, President Biden has opened a back door to allow hundreds of thousands of new immigrants into the country, significantly expanding the use of humanitarian parole programs for people escaping war and political turmoil around the world."
Illinois,Q2,"The prohibition is among the most restrictive in the country, and Florida will no longer be a destination for women from across the Deep South seeking the procedure. MIAMI — Florida lawmakers voted to prohibit abortions after six weeks of pregnancy on Thursday, culminating a rapid effort by elected Republicans and Gov. Ron DeSantis to transform the state to one of the most restrictive in the country."

Illinois,Q2,"Plus, Australian efforts to break with China on lithium. Fighting raged for a second day in southern Russia as a pro-Ukrainian group of fighters carried out more attacks in the region of Belgorod, near Ukraine’s border. An explosion was reported at a defense factory, and skirmishes reportedly broke out at a crossing."
Illinois,Q2,"Congress should ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Last week, the Senate held a vote on the Equal Rights Amendment — the latest development in a century-long effort to amend the Constitution to explicitly guarantee sex equality. The E.R.A. resolution received 51 (bipartisan) votes but fell short of the 60 votes necessary to advance under the Senate’s current rules."
Illinois,Q2,"The flurry of transactions highlighted how members of Congress continue to buy and sell stocks in industries that intersect with their official duties. WASHINGTON — On March 10, as fears were swirling over the health of the nation’s banks, an investment account belonging to the children of Representative Jared Moskowitz, Democrat of Florida, sold shares of Seacoast Banking Corporation worth $65,000 to $150,000."
Illinois,Q2,"While clinics in some states expanded capacity, bans prevented thousands from getting legal abortions, a major new survey of abortion providers finds. The number of legal abortions in the United States decreased just over 6 percent in the six months after the Supreme Court ended the right to abortion last June, according to a report released Tuesday, the most comprehensive and up-to-date count of abortions nationwide."
Illinois,Q2,"In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities. In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities."
Illinois,Q2,"Brandon Johnson, a progressive Democrat, prevailed over his more moderate challenger after holding the position that officials must take a fundamentally different approach to public safety. CHICAGO — The mayoral victory on Tuesday of Brandon Johnson, a once little-known progressive and former teacher, over a more moderate veteran of this city’s burly political realm injected confidence in the Democratic Party’s most liberal wing — and may have pointed a way forward for the party on the fraught issue of crime."
Illinois,Q2,"New York City’s pioneering, focused approach sets rules on how companies use the technology in work force decisions. European lawmakers are finishing work on an A.I. act. The Biden administration and leaders in Congress have their plans for reining in artificial intelligence. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, maker of the A.I. sensation ChatGPT, recommended the creation of a federal agency with oversight and licensing authority in Senate testimony last week. And the topic came up at the Group of 7 summit in Japan."
Illinois,Q2,"Federal officials are investigating the railroad’s safety practices and culture after the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and worker deaths. Norfolk Southern once had so few accidents and injuries that it won the rail industry’s prestigious E.H. Harriman safety award for 23 years in a row until it was retired in 2012. But in the last decade, the company has gone from an industry leader to a laggard."
Illinois,Q2,"A product of a Wisconsin lake region, he was the first sailor to win both Olympic gold and sailing’s top prize, the America’s Cup. And his colleagues revered him. Buddy Melges, a Wisconsin native who became the first sailor to win both an Olympic gold medal and the sport’s top prize, the America’s Cup, died on Thursday at his home in Fontana, Wis., on the western shore of Geneva Lake. He was 93."
Illinois,Q2,"Investigators released a trove of documents about the derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train in Ohio, the subject of a two-day hearing that began Thursday. The National Transportation Safety Board released thousands of pages of documents on Thursday about the derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train in East Palestine, Ohio, providing the fullest account yet of what had led to the accident."
Illinois,Q2,"A federal judge in Washington State issued a ruling ordering the Food and Drug Administration to make no changes to the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone on Friday, directly contradicting another judge’s ruling in a legal standoff likely to escalate to the Supreme Court.

Illinois,Q2,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Illinois,Q2,"The final vote on Thursday night came after leaders put down a revolt by some senators who raised concerns that the debt-limit package would under-fund the Pentagon. After weeks of political impasse, tense negotiations and mounting economic anxiety, the Senate gave final approval on Thursday night to bipartisan legislation suspending the debt limit and imposing new spending caps, sending it to President Biden and ending the possibility of a calamitous government default."
Illinois,Q2,"A tentative agreement between the school district and the educators’ union includes several provisions meant to improve the lives of students and their families. Thousands of Oakland students will return to school today, after about 3,000 striking public school educators reached a tentative deal with district officials to raise salaries for teachers and take some unconventional steps to improve students’ lives, including creating a Black reparations task force and using district property to help homeless students."
Illinois,Q2,"Around the world, tens of millions could lose their homes in the coming decades. Planning is the key to protecting them. What does a country do when rising seas threaten to swamp its coastal capital?"
Illinois,Q2,"Paul Vallas, who pressed for a more conservative approach, narrowly lost to Mr. Johnson, who was little known to voters only months ago. CHICAGO — Brandon Johnson, a county commissioner and teachers’ union organizer who called for a vast expansion of social programs in Chicago, as well as new taxes, was elected mayor of the country’s third-largest city on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press."
Illinois,Q2,"Modi’s version of India is as skewed as Donald Trump’s of the U.S, but Modi has done better at getting the media and global elite to buy into it. On Thursday the White House will roll out the red carpet for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to “affirm the deep and close partnership between the United States and India” and “strengthen our two countries’ shared commitment to a free, open, prosperous, and secure Indo-Pacific.” A state dinner and Mr. Modi’s address to a joint session of Congress will crown months of fawning assessments of India by everyone from Bill Gates to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. The message couldn’t be plainer: In Cold War II with China, the United States wants India on its side."
Illinois,Q2,"How grief has warped the lives of the Uvalde shooting victims’ families and friends. The United States experiences so many mass shootings that journalists do not usually linger long after the attacks. Reporters and photographers move on to other stories, while the families and friends of the victims continue to grieve."
Illinois,Q2,"W.E.B. Du Bois saw the key to Black prosperity in places like Tulsa, where Black residents patronized Black stores. Even today it serves as a model. When W.E.B. Du Bois visited the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Okla., in early 1921, he, like so many others, was impressed by what he found. The famed intellectual had been on the road for weeks on a Southern lecture tour. In his travel diary, he wrote of brutal lynchings and brutalization that were as old as the nation itself — older, in fact.  What grabbed Du Bois’s attention was what his people were accomplishing despite it. “One notes all through the south, with some exception, the new hope and power of the colored folk,” he wrote in his diary. “It is not any increased faith in the white people — quite the contrary — it is a distinct sense of their own ability.”"
Illinois,Q2,"The Denver airport is a magnet for conspiracy theories — and a case study in the line between mass delusion and fun. Equine art lives in many airports: Seattle and San Francisco have bronze horses shaped like driftwood, Central Illinois has wire horses suspended from the ceiling, Tucson has a winged horse and Barcelona has a burly horse."
Illinois,Q2,"The annual festival of furnishings and household objects has several presentations involving cloth materials and techniques. If it’s denim you like, you can check out the decommissioned church where the Dutch fashion brand G-Star has invited the designer Maarten Baas to produce a full-size airplane from the material. If your tastes in textiles fly higher, Hermès is showing a carpet by the French designer Pierre Charpin made with the exquisite, labor-intensive cordélie technique."
Illinois,Q2,"Asylum seekers are pouring in at a fraught moment, when Chicago is changing mayors, its shelters are full, and a pandemic-driven restriction at the southern border is expected to end. CHICAGO — Bulging suitcases lined the wall of windows facing the street at a North Side police station in Chicago one morning this week. Air mattresses, blankets and pillows covered the shiny lobby floor. And more than 40 women, men and children were crowded together wherever they could find space — sleeping, chatting in Spanish or eating forkfuls of scrambled eggs and sausages that a volunteer had arranged on a long table."
Illinois,Q2,"With single-party statehouse control at its highest level in decades, legislators across much of the country leaned into cultural issues and bulldozed the opposition. America’s state capitals are as polarized as they have been in decades, with lawmakers imposing unflinchingly conservative or liberal agendas this year, even in politically diverse places."
Illinois,Q2,A push and pull between progressive and moderate Democrats is shaping the party’s policies and politics. Progressive victories in Wisconsin and Chicago have injected new momentum into the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party. But those recent electoral successes are masking deeper internal tensions over the role and influence of progressives in a party President Biden has been remaking in his moderate image.
Illinois,Q2,"He introduced sex and glamour to Italian TV and then brought the same formula to politics, dominating the country and its culture for more than 20 years. ROME — Silvio Berlusconi, the brash media mogul who revolutionized Italian television using privately owned channels to become the country’s most polarizing and prosecuted prime minister over multiple stints in office and an often scandalous quarter-century of political and cultural influence, died on Monday at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan. He was 86.  "
Illinois,Q2,"Desperate to improve their ratings, Americans now spend billions on “credit repair” — but the industry often can’t deliver on its promises. When Taqwanna Clark went to buy a video camera at Fry’s Electronics in Houston, she asked if they had a layaway plan. The cashier instead handed her an application for a store credit card. She applied. “Instantly, it came back declined — like, No!” she says. “Denied, denied — you know, your credit is not good enough.” Clark was 30 and working as a security guard at the Port of Houston. On weekends, she performed as a rapper in the local club scene, under the name T-Baby. She wanted the camera to shoot music videos, to promote her music career. “If I can’t afford a $200 camera,” she recalls thinking, “then I’m in a bad way with this credit thing.”"
Illinois,Q3,"A new study suggests a link, but experts caution that there’s more to the story. A large new study in Denmark suggested that hormone therapy — which women use to manage menopausal symptoms — was associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia. The study found that the heightened risk was even present in women who started the therapy at 55 or younger and in short term users."
Illinois,Q3,"In the United States, smoke from wildfires is undoing progress from the Clean Air Act. In poorer countries, the situation is even worse. On the heels of an exceptionally fiery and smoky summer, two new reports released Wednesday confirmed what many Americans have been already seeing and breathing."
Illinois,Q3,"States can push hospitals to look at California’s model and other proven ways to reduce maternal mortality. Years ago, researchers discovered that American women were dying in childbirth at an alarming rate, far higher than in many other Western countries. Black women, they found, were dying at even more elevated rates. Data in hand, they called for change."
Illinois,Q3,"A successor to Mr. Jackson, the civil rights leader, will be announced at the group’s convention this weekend. Mr. Jackson, 81, announced in 2017 that he had Parkinson’s disease. The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr., the longtime civil rights leader and former Democratic presidential candidate, plans to step down as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the organization he founded, the group said in a statement on Friday."
Illinois,Q3,"Do we own our bodies? The answer, according to many legal experts, is no. Do we own our bodies? To an ordinary person, the answer is obviously yes. To a lawyer, it’s not at all clear. That discrepancy needs to be resolved."
Illinois,Q3,"In eight states, the estimated number of abortions increased by 60 percent or more as patients crossed state lines seeking care. In eight states, the estimated number of abortions increased by 60 percent or more as patients crossed state lines seeking care."
Illinois,Q3,"Congress has long been an institution that runs on seniority and rewards longevity, and these veteran lawmakers are still running the country at an age when most people are well into retirement. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the 81-year-old longtime Republican leader, has batted away questions about his health after twice freezing on camera, insisting he has no plans to step down ahead of schedule as the leader of his party in the Senate."
Illinois,Q3,"He was never charged with the deaths of seven people from cyanide-laced Tylenol, but he was convicted of extortion after he sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson demanding $1 million to “stop the killing.” James W. Lewis, the prime suspect in the deaths of seven people in 1982 from cyanide-laced Tylenol — a poisoning that terrified the nation and changed the way manufacturers packaged medications — died on Sunday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 76."
Illinois,Q3,"Most potential consumers were excited by the prospect, though sticker price and safety were lingering concerns. On Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved a hormonal birth control pill, called Opill, to be sold over the counter — a landmark decision that was largely received with excitement by many women and teenage girls in New York. The pill will be sold in stores and online, without age restrictions, beginning early next year."
Illinois,Q3,"Meiko Locksley was found to have had a degenerative brain disease often associated with football. His father, the head coach at Maryland, is still reckoning with the implications. Michael Locksley was helping coach Alabama to a national championship in 2017 when his 25-year-old son, Meiko, was shot and killed."
Illinois,Q3,More than 57 million people were under an excessive heat warning — the most severe category for heat conditions — and another 54 million people were under a heat advisory. More than 57 million people in the American South and Southwest were under an excessive heat warning on Saturday afternoon — the most severe category for heat conditions — as temperatures across the Gulf Coast and parts of the Southwest soared to record-breaking levels and were expected to remain high through early next week.
Illinois,Q3,"The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, after the Supreme Court’s ruling. After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year, it looked like the number of abortions would soon plummet across the country. But new estimates suggest that has not happened. The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, nationwide since 2020, our colleagues Amy Schoenfeld Walker and Allison McCann reported today."
Illinois,Q3,"Child poverty more than doubled last year. It doesn’t have to be this way. The annual Census Bureau report released earlier this month revealed that child poverty more than doubled in the United States last year, the largest single-year increase on record. The news feels less like a surprise and more like a confirmation, if not a deliberate choice."
Illinois,Q3,"The increase in poverty reversed two years of large declines. Median income, adjusted for inflation, fell 2.3 percent to $74,580. Poverty increased sharply last year in the United States, particularly among children, as living costs rose and federal programs that provided aid to families during the pandemic were allowed to expire."
Illinois,Q3,"These life adventurers are achieving financial wellness and fueling their ambitions and passions. Here's how you can, too. "
Illinois,Q3,"We need to meet people resisting wind and solar power with gentleness and curiosity. This summer, as my children splashed in the freakishly warm ocean waves by the beautiful Victorian seaside town of Cape May, N.J., angry protesters gathered a few towns away."
Illinois,Q3,"The United Auto Workers union is seeking big raises and other gains in contract talks with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. The United Auto Workers union said on Friday that 97 percent of its members had voted to authorize strikes against General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis if the union and companies were unable to negotiate new labor contracts."
Illinois,Q3,"Michelle Evans and Eric Koch did not think second marriages were in their future — until a mutual friend urged them to connect. The Brady Bunch have nothing on Michelle Lynn Evans and Eric Randolph Koch: Between the two of them, they have eight children and 48 years of marriage with former partners. While Ms. Evans had no intention of marrying again, and Dr. Koch remained ambivalent as well, Facebook and a mutual friend, Susan Ramos, changed all that."
Illinois,Q3,"The move, announced late Wednesday, followed intense lobbying by New York Democrats before and during President Biden’s visit to New York City this week. The Biden administration said late Wednesday that it would allow hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans already in the United States to live and work legally in the country for 18 months."
Illinois,Q3,"Seven poses to help you wake up and feel energized, whether you’re an expert or a beginner. Seven poses to help you wake up and feel energized, whether you’re an expert or a beginner."
Illinois,Q3,A Supreme Court decision created a 50-state patchwork of differing abortion laws. An eclectic network of volunteers and organizations has tried to fill the gaps in health care and support. A Supreme Court decision created a 50-state patchwork of differing abortion laws. An eclectic network of volunteers and organizations has tried to fill the gaps in health care and support.
Illinois,Q3,"The fare is free for those older than 65, and so some retired people spend their days riding the trains to the end of the line. The subway rumbled toward its final stop north of Seoul. Along the way, hordes disembarked, with the determined, brisk gait of those with somewhere to be."
Illinois,Q3,"Proponents of the measure to enshrine a guarantee of sex equality into the Constitution are using a creative legal theory to try to resurrect the long-stalled amendment. Democrats in Congress are making a fresh push for the nearly century-old Equal Rights Amendment to be enshrined in the Constitution, rallying around a creative legal theory in a bid to revive an amendment that would explicitly guarantee sex equality as a way to protect reproductive rights in post-Roe America."
Illinois,Q3,"The butter cow is a state fair institution. But the sculptors say there’s more than dairy to these pale yellow works of art. The oily visage of a butter cow is an alluring sight at state fairs across the nation, but few people have taken the time to think about what’s inside them. Warning: It’s not more butter."
Illinois,Q3,"The strain of migrants in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities has taxed resources, divided Democrats and put pressure on President Biden to act. When Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas began sending migrants and asylum seekers from the southwestern frontier to New York, Washington and Chicago, he vowed to bring the border to the Democratic cities he said were naïvely dismissing its costs."
Illinois,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated. In the wake of the decision, 15 largely conservative states imposed near-total bans (through trigger laws or new legislation), and two more set limits at six weeks of pregnancy. "
Illinois,Q3,"Gov. Kim Reynolds called the Legislature for a special session to consider sweeping new restrictions on abortion. Less than a month after a deadlocked Iowa Supreme Court left a six-week abortion ban unenforceable, lawmakers returned to the State Capitol on Tuesday and passed a nearly identical set of restrictions on the procedure."
Illinois,Q3,"After Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, some feared that other court rulings, including the 2003 decision that invalidated sodomy laws, could be revisited. Maryland and Minnesota recently repealed theirs. It has been 20 years since the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws with its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, but legal codes inherited from colonial laws and used to prosecute L.G.B.T.Q. people by banning some sexual acts remain in place across the country."
Illinois,Q3,"For Republicans in 2008, he briefly became a symbol of Middle America when he questioned the presidential candidate Barack Obama in a televised encounter. Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, who briefly became “Joe the Plumber,” the metaphorical American middle-class Everyman, by injecting himself into the 2008 presidential campaign in an impromptu nationally-televised face-off with Barack Obama over taxing small businesses, died on Sunday at his home in Campbellsport, Wis., about 60 miles north of Milwaukee. He was 49."
Illinois,Q3,"Whether their portraits were in oil paint or digital photography, presidents have always sought the same thing: control. Eagerly anticipated and immediately meme-ified, the mug shot of Donald Trump that the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office circulated last week was in some ways utterly conventional: a head-and-shoulders view with unflattering lighting and a law enforcement logo in the corner."
Illinois,Q3,"The industry has used its muscle to prevent federal, state and local governments from penalizing companies that park freight trains across roads for hours or days. Freight trains frequently stop and block the roads of York, Ala., sometimes cutting off two neighborhoods for hours. Emergency services and health care workers can’t get in, and those trapped inside can’t get out."
Illinois,Q3,"He took the extraordinary step of banning tackling during all practices, which reduced concussions at a time when brain trauma in football had become a crisis. Buddy Teevens, who had more victories than any coach in Dartmouth College football history, and who became a nationally recognized innovator in player safety when he eliminated tackling during practices to limit the incidence of concussions, died on Tuesday in Boston. He was 66."
Illinois,Q3,Congress is unwilling to change entrenched immigration laws. Other options face lawsuits or backlogs that could lead to even longer waits. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has blamed the White House for failing to respond to her call to expedite work permits for the influx of migrants arriving in the state.
Illinois,Q3,"For some formerly religious people, exercising together creates connection and community. This is a follow-up to my series on Americans moving away from organized religion. Read part one, part two, part three, part four and part five."
Illinois,Q3,Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces his biggest test since the debt ceiling showdown as right-wing Republicans demand deep spending cuts and tougher border policies opposed by the White House and Senate. Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s job is on the line as the House returns on Tuesday to confront a funding impasse that could lead to a government shutdown or a challenge to the California Republican’s hold on the top post in the House.
Illinois,Q3,More states are establishing paid leave programs that could help caregivers protect their nest eggs. Tara Driver would love to retire before age 70. But it’s not going to be easy.
Illinois,Q3,"The Utah Republican’s announcement that he would retire coincided with the publication of a forthcoming book based on extensive interviews in which he slammed his party and the Senate. When Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, announced on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in 2024, it was the culmination of a long estrangement between Mr. Romney and his party."
Illinois,Q3,"Officials want to tear down the house where four Idaho college students were murdered last year, setting off a debate over preserving the scenes of mass violence. At the house where four University of Idaho students were murdered last year, sheets of plywood cover the windows. A temporary fence surrounds the yard. Security guards, posted in a blue trailer, keep watch 24 hours a day."
Illinois,Q3,"He was publisher of The Chicago Sun-Times, where he was also the top editor, and New York’s Daily News. He was later editor of Foreign Affairs magazine. James Hoge, who was a blue-blooded editor and publisher of blue-collar newspapers in Chicago and New York for a quarter-century and then long guided a leading journal on international relations, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 87."
Illinois,Q3,"Rex Heuermann was painstaking in his Manhattan professional pursuits. At home in Massapequa Park, he left neighbors discomfited. At his office near the Empire State Building, Rex Heuermann was a master of the meticulous: a veteran architectural consultant and a self-styled expert at navigating the intricacies of New York City’s building code. He impressed some clients and drove others crazy with his fine-toothed directives."
Illinois,Q3,"Marc Tessier-Lavigne was cleared of accusations of scientific fraud and misconduct. But the review said his work had “multiple problems” and “fell below customary standards of scientific rigor.” Following months of intense scrutiny of his scientific work, Marc Tessier-Lavigne announced Wednesday that he would resign as president of Stanford University after an independent review of his research found significant flaws in studies he supervised going back decades."
Illinois,Q3,"A lawyer started small with a creative tactic. It grew into an effort that could force fossil fuel companies to pay hundreds of billions in damages. Missy Sims carefully picked her way through a field of ruined tombs in central Puerto Rico, in a cemetery where walls of water from Hurricane Maria had smashed open some coffins and sent others careering into a nearby stream."
Illinois,Q3,"Many Americans fear a second Trump term and are dissatisfied. No Labels is here to take advantage of that sadness with a half-finished idea. GOFFSTOWN, N.H. — “I’m not afraid of losing,” Senator Joe Manchin said, with some real charm and conviction, on Monday night."
Illinois,Q3,"Virtual fencing has the potential to make a sweeping impact on the American West’s inhabitants, human and animal alike. “Wherever a farm may be located, or whatever may be its production, fence, fence, fence is the first, the intermediate and the last consideration,” the farmer and journalist Sereno Edwards Todd wrote in 1860. Fences keep livestock in and predators out, and both were imperative for the settlers drawn to the Great Plains by the government’s promises of free land. But on the Plains in the mid-19th century, newcomers found that timber was scarce, stone walls were impractical and living fences, usually thorny hedges of Osage orange, took years to grow."
Illinois,Q3,"Malcolm X at the Met. Jaap van Zweden’s farewell to the New York Philharmonic. Premieres by Kate Soper and Ted Hearne. It’s shaping up to be quite a season. This is a season of transition for two of New York’s most important arts institutions. Opening with Jake Heggie’s “Dead Man Walking,” from 2000, the Metropolitan Opera will see whether fewer titles and more contemporary works (including “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X” and “Florencia en el Amazonas”) help solve its financial problems. And Jaap van Zweden, the New York Philharmonic’s music director since 2018, starts his final year in the position with help from Yo-Yo Ma, Steve Reich and Schubert. Grand orchestras like the Chicago Symphony and Staatskapelle Berlin at Carnegie Hall; the Emerson String Quartet’s farewell; and premieres by Kate Soper and Ted Hearne are among the other highlights coming this fall."
Illinois,Q3,"But we are still in the dark about 2024. One of the most significant developments in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election has emerged largely under the radar. From 2016 to 2022, the number of white people without college degrees — the core of Donald Trump’s support — has fallen by 2.1 million."
Illinois,Q3,"“They are not going to settle for the second-best Trump.” Earlier this year, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, appeared to be a formidable challenger to Donald Trump — on paper at least."

Illinois,Q3,"Josh Koskoff’s legal victory against Remington has raised the possibility of a new form of gun control: lawsuits against the companies that make assault rifles. Brian Hogan was standing in front of a wrought-iron tree bench, head bowed, as Josh Koskoff approached him. "
Illinois,Q4,"Bernice Heiderman, a 24-year-old Peace Corps volunteer, died of undiagnosed malaria in the African island nation of Comoros in 2018. Her family sued. The Peace Corps, which has repeatedly come under scrutiny for the medical care it provides to volunteers, has agreed to pay $750,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by the family of a 24-year-old volunteer who died of undiagnosed malaria in the island nation of Comoros off the coast of East Africa."
Illinois,Q4,"The federal aviation agency plans to form a panel to look into the potential risks posed by a fatigued work force, after a spate of close calls this year. The Federal Aviation Administration is planning to form a panel to look into the potential risks posed by exhaustion among air traffic controllers, many of whom have been working round-the-clock schedules that have pushed them to the physical and emotional brink."
Illinois,Q4,"The actions coincided with a period of increasing labor activism by workers in other sectors, including the auto industry and Hollywood. Some pharmacy workers are calling in sick or walking off the job this week to protest what they call inadequate staffing and increasing work requirements, according to protest organizers, and say it’s harder to do their jobs safely."
Illinois,Q4,"The proposal has elicited mounting opposition from tobacco companies, Black activists worried about police enforcement and small businesses, as President Biden moves into an election year. The Biden administration delayed a decision on Wednesday about whether it would ban menthol cigarettes amid intense lobbying from tobacco companies, convenience stores and industry-backed groups that contend that billions of dollars in sales and jobs will be lost."
Illinois,Q4,"Northview Village, the city’s largest nursing home, closed so abruptly that some relatives struggled to find their loved ones. There was no warning when a line of vans showed up outside the largest nursing home in St. Louis Friday afternoon, workers at the home said."
Illinois,Q4,"Some of the most popular influencers can amass small fortunes before they’re 18, but there are few legal protections to ensure their earnings remain their own. By now, the story of Britney Spears’s conservatorship and its eventual unraveling is well known: For years, Ms. Spears was trapped in a legal situation in which most of the money she earned went to her father, who controlled not only her finances, but things like her medication, her performance schedule and more."
Illinois,Q4,"Dr. Murphy’s safe, reliable blood bag replaced breakable glass bottles used in transfusions in the Korean War. He also helped improve pacemakers and artificial kidneys. Dr. William P. Murphy Jr., a biomedical engineer who was an inventor of the vinyl blood bag that replaced breakable bottles in the Korean War and made transfusions safe and reliable on battlefields, in hospitals and at scenes of natural disasters and accidents, died on Thursday at his home in Coral Gables, Fla. He was 100."
Illinois,Q4,"The Biden administration, which has pressed Israel to do more to safeguard civilian lives, said Israel had agreed to steps to help people flee the northern Gaza Strip and receive aid. Israeli soldiers and armored vehicles have engaged Hamas fighters in days of running gun battles in Gaza City, fighting through rubble-filled streets and blasted-out buildings for control of the Gaza Strip’s largest urban center and the militants’ main stronghold."
Illinois,Q4,"A variety of common canine pathogens, none of them new, could be driving the recent outbreaks. Scientists and health officials are scrambling to find an explanation for the outbreaks of severe respiratory illness that have been sickening dogs across the United States."
Illinois,Q4,"The influx of migrants is taxing the social safety net in the U.S. Will Democrats pay the price for it? For far too long, too many Americans considered the border to be someone else’s problem — someone in Texas, maybe, or Arizona or California. People who didn’t live near the border might have condemned harsh tactics used there or offered their communities as sanctuaries for those who managed to slip across it. But for the most part, the challenges of the border remained at the border. Out of sight, out of mind."
Illinois,Q4,"Longevity drugs for our canine companions are moving closer to reality. They also raise questions about what it might mean to succeed. The life of a pet dog follows a predictable trajectory. Over time, the floppy-eared puppy that keeps falling asleep in his food bowl will become a lanky-legged adolescent with an insatiable interest in squirrels — before eventually settling into adulthood as a canine creature of habit, with a carefully chosen napping location and a well-rehearsed greeting ritual."
Illinois,Q4,"The first full-year census of U.S. abortion providers shows significant increases in abortion in states where it’s legal. In the year after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion, something unexpected happened: The total number of legal abortions in the United States did not fall. Instead, it appeared to increase slightly, by about 0.2 percent, according to the first full-year count of abortions provided nationwide."
Illinois,Q4,"Some vapes are appearing with increasing nicotine levels that approach those in a carton of cigarettes. U.S. regulators did not authorize them, but have failed to keep them off shelves. Juul was once the cool vape, blamed for hooking teenagers on e-cigarettes, and it is set to pay billions of dollars in legal settlements."
Illinois,Q4,"The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term. The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows."
Illinois,Q4,"A staple of the Seattle bar scene, he was both a throwback to an earlier era and an inspiration for a new generation of bartenders. Murray Stenson didn’t look like a revolutionary. Balding and slightly stooped, the son of a small-town grade-school principal, he spent decades quietly making cocktails at bars around Seattle, honing his classic, unfussy style. He favored regulars over celebrities, steady work over flair, handwritten notes over email."
Illinois,Q4,"Medicine has a chance to get a cure for sickle cell disease right. The sickle cell crises were always different. Sometimes Lynndrick Holmes would wake up with a searing pain in his legs, as though there were knives growing out of his bones. Sometimes it was in his arms, like needles digging into his nerves. Other times it was in his chest. The air felt heavy and every breath burned as though there were a barbed wire cage around his lungs."
Illinois,Q4,"For starters, we heard something unexpected from both Democrats and Republicans about the economy. For starters, we heard something unexpected from both Democrats and Republicans about the economy."
Illinois,Q4,"The court’s three liberal justices dissented, saying that the prisoner, Michael Johnson, should be able to challenge prolonged denial of fresh air. Over a forceful dissent from its three liberal members, the Supreme Court on Monday turned down an appeal from a prisoner in Illinois held in solitary confinement who said that prolonged denial of outdoor exercise was cruel and unusual punishment."
Illinois,Q4,"With aid to Ukraine and Israel in limbo, a border deal elusive and a mountain of spending legislation left undone, the House turned its attention to whole milk in schools. With one day to go until Congress plans to call it quits for the year and members head home for the holidays, the House got down to pressing business on Wednesday, using its precious remaining time to pass legislation to bring whole milk back to America’s school cafeterias."
Illinois,Q4,"A lower court is now expected to hear arguments on the broader question of whether the right to privacy in the state constitution protects a right to abortion. Georgia’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition of abortion Tuesday, rejecting arguments made by doctors and advocacy groups that the law was unconstitutional when the state legislature approved it in 2019, more than three years before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade."
Illinois,Q4,"The effects of the pandemic on children are persistent and require urgent attention. In the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic, Congress sent $190 billion in aid to schools, stipulating that 20 percent of the funds had to be used for reversing learning setbacks. At the time, educators knew that the impact on how children learn would be significant, but the extent was not yet known."
Illinois,Q4,"Also, Stephen Sondheim’s last musical opens in New York. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. Hamas released two women who were taken hostage by the Palestinian group during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The Red Cross confirmed their release, saying that it had helped to transfer the women out of Gaza this evening."
Illinois,Q4,"Long the epitome of holiday luxury in America, the cut’s place on the table has changed with tastes — and the economy. On a biting December evening, the St. Clair Supper Club in Chicago’s West Loop neighborhood offered an escape out of the weather — and into America’s culinary past."
Illinois,Q4,"The new speaker, Mike Johnson, is virtually unknown to most Americans, but he can be expected to press a hard-right social and fiscal agenda. In the end, Republican hard-liners got their man."
Illinois,Q4,"Migrant children, put to work in one of the nation’s most dangerous jobs, are falling and dying. Migrant children, put to work in one of the nation’s most dangerous jobs, are falling and dying."
Illinois,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Illinois,Q4,"Four terrifying, unnerving picks across television, film and podcast. It’s the time of year when I tend to push the boundaries of how many scary stories I can stomach. That includes horror movies, but also, true crime offerings that I may have skipped. Of course, with true crime, that self-soothing mantra of “at least it’s not real” doesn’t apply, which makes it all the more haunting. Here are four picks that shook me to my core."
Illinois,Q4,"A new study found that California schools got positive results from a targeted investment in the science of reading — even with the challenges of pandemic recovery. To try to make up for pandemic learning loss, educators and policymakers have searched for solutions that work and — just as important — are cost effective."
Illinois,Q4,"Though school trips have evolved as science curriculums have changed, 400,000 children still flock to the American Museum of Natural History every year. Good morning. It’s Wednesday. We’ll look at how school field trips are evolving. We’ll also find out what Gov. Kathy Hochul said as she signed a bill that called for a state task force to consider reparations for the lasting impact of slavery."
Illinois,Q4,"A majority of the Democratic caucus signed a letter asking President Biden to ensure that Israel has a viable plan for defeating Hamas and will use U.S. military assistance in keeping with international law. A majority of the Senate Democratic caucus called on President Biden on Wednesday to defend his request for $14.3 billion in emergency military assistance for Israel, seeking assurances that the Jewish state has a viable plan for defeating Hamas and that the United States will not be funding actions that run afoul of international and U.S. laws."
Illinois,Q4,"They have grown more vocal about urging measures to mitigate civilian casualties in Gaza, but supporters of a cease-fire are few and far between. Democrats in Congress, torn between their support for Israel in its war with Hamas and concern about civilian suffering in Gaza, are struggling with how far to go in calling for measures to mitigate civilian casualties as the left wing of the party escalates pressure for a cease-fire."
Illinois,Q4,"Despite conflicts overseas and an approaching deadline to avert a government shutdown, Republicans are unable to rise above their internal divisions. Two key U.S. allies are engulfed in vicious wars. A disruptive government shutdown is looming in just over a month. Americans are held hostage overseas by hostile forces. Uncertainty ripples across the country."
Illinois,Q4,"Also, we preview Teju Cole’s new book. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. President Biden is considering making an extraordinary trip to Israel in the coming days to demonstrate American solidarity with the country after the terrorist attacks carried out there by Hamas this month."
Illinois,Q4,"Wednesday’s four-hour meeting in San Francisco resulted in few breakthroughs. But C.E.O.s gave the Chinese leader a standing ovation at a banquet afterward. The mood music was upbeat but pragmatic after the first face-to-face meeting in a year between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. There was no joint communiqué after Wednesday’s talks, but both sides issued positive statements trumpeting where they found common ground, including on tackling climate change and improving communications."
Illinois,Q4,"Rolling strikes are planned at four of the largest campuses in the university system, which together enroll more than 100,000 students. Thousands of faculty members at the nation’s largest four-year public university system are canceling classes and mounting rolling strikes this week as they demand higher pay and better benefits."
Illinois,Q4,The battle over the hospital highlights the lack of simple answers in Gaza. The battle over Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza highlights a tension that often goes unmentioned in the debate over the war between Israel and Hamas: There may be no way for Israel both to minimize civilian casualties and to eliminate Hamas.
Illinois,Q4,"The progressive disappointment with the Vermont senator, a liberal icon, reflects a broader divide among Democrats over the war. On a Democratic primary debate stage in Brooklyn in 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders caused a ruckus within his party when he rebuked Hillary Clinton for not mentioning Palestinian rights in a speech she made to a pro-Israel lobbying group."
Illinois,Q4,"There seems to be a sense of both resignation (we’ve been here before) and shock (but we’ve been here before). When President Biden landed in Tel Aviv days after Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre of more than 1,400 people, he told an audience of Israelis that this was not just Israel’s Sept. 11, that “it was like 15 9/11s.”"
Illinois,Q4,"President Biden is set to issue new rules on the technology, days ahead of an international summit on A.I. safety. President Biden is set to issue an executive order on artificial intelligence on Monday, in his first effort to regulate how U.S. companies develop it and how regulators oversee the technology. The order will create standards for American companies and public agencies."
Illinois,Q4,"The Bidens invited more than 300 guests, including business leaders, musicians, athletes and prominent Australian Americans. The White House invited more than 300 guests to the state dinner hosted by President Biden for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia on Wednesday night, including business leaders, musicians, athletes and prominent Australian Americans. Here is the full list of those invited as provided by the White House."
Illinois,Q4,"After Hamas attacked Israel, some U.S. Palestinians said that American politicians and news outlets ignored underlying causes and took Israel’s side. As news spread over the weekend that gunmen from Hamas, the Palestinian faction that governs the Gaza Strip, had killed hundreds and taken hostages in a surprise attack on Israel, Zarefah Baroud watched in horror from Seattle."
Illinois,Q4,"The group discusses what the Democratic Party means to them, its current strategy and its future after Biden. The group discusses what the Democratic Party means to them, its current strategy and its future after Biden."
Illinois,Q4,Policies restricting phone use in schools are trending. We asked students if they thought such rules were a good idea. Nearly one in four countries has laws or policies banning or restricting student cellphone use in schools. Proponents say no-phone rules reduce student distractions and bullying. Critics say the bans could hinder student self-direction and critical thinking.
Illinois,Q4,"Show us your thinking about a recent Times article, video, graph, photo essay or podcast. Open from Dec. 6, 2023 to Jan. 10, 2024. Update, March 7: Winners have been announced!"
Illinois,Q4,"A collection of resources to help students learn about Hamas’s recent attack on Israel, the dire situation in Gaza, the conflict’s roots, media literacy and more. Update, Jan. 27: We published new resources for teaching about the Israel-Hamas war."
Illinois,Q4,"How Jack Fisk, the master production designer behind ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ and many other films, brings the past to life. Kihekah Avenue cuts through the town of Pawhuska, Okla., roughly north to south, forming the only corridor you might call a “business district” in the town of 2,900. Standing in the middle is a small TV-and-appliance store called Hometown, which occupies a two-story brick building and hasn’t changed much in decades. Boards cover its second-story windows, and part of the sign above its awning is broken, leaving half the lettering intact, spelling “Home.” The space inside, in the language of the plains, is “humble”: Its ceilings are low, its walls wood-paneled, its floors carpeted in tight-woven grids. If it weren’t for the giant inflatable University of Oklahoma Sooners mascot in its front-window display, the store would be easy to miss completely."
Illinois,Q4,"An altercation in San Francisco has raised fears about the city’s future — but also questions about what really happened. Responding to 911 calls about a street fight in the Marina district, the police found Don Carmignani, 53, standing on the sidewalk with blood streaming down his face. It was 7:20 p.m. on April 5 — twilight — and multiple witnesses had gotten a clean view of Carmignani’s attacker: a young homeless man who was a familiar presence in the neighborhood. The police arrested him two minutes later, right down the block. An ambulance took Carmignani to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital."
Illinois,Q4,Answers to your questions about one of the biggest challenges facing students. Answers to your questions about one of the biggest challenges facing students.
Indiana,Q1,A lawsuit is challenging the F.D.A.’s approval of medication abortion. Data shows the consequences could be far-reaching. A lawsuit is challenging the F.D.A.’s approval of medication abortion. Data shows the consequences could be far-reaching.
Indiana,Q1,"After two unsuccessful runs for the presidency, the Vermont senator now leads the Senate health committee, a job that gives him sweeping jurisdiction over issues he cares about. WASHINGTON — In two unsuccessful bids for the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders made no secret of his disdain for billionaires. Now, in what could be his final act in Washington, he has the power to summon them to testify before Congress — and he has a few corporate executives in his sights."
Indiana,Q1,"Many of the legal arguments seeking to overturn abortion bans rely on rights provided by the states, and how they are interpreted by state supreme courts. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in June, it declared that it was sending the issue back to the “people and their elected representatives.” But the fight has largely moved to a different set of supreme courts and constitutions: those in the states."
Indiana,Q1,We spoke to exercise experts to find the ideal regimen. Q: How much cardiovascular exercise versus strength training should I do each week?
Indiana,Q1,"Kizzmekia Corbett helped lead a team of scientists contributing to one of the most stunning achievements in the history of immunizations: a highly effective, easily manufactured vaccine against Covid-19. “Transforming Spaces” is a series about women driving change in sometimes unexpected places."
Indiana,Q1,"Judges in 19 states and the District of Columbia are issuing orders to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed dangerous, like a Fort Lauderdale teenager who threatened a school shooting. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Seagull Alternative High School sits behind locked gates and a chain-link fence, a complex of low-slung buildings that provides an academic home for pregnant teenagers and students at risk of dropping out. On a Tuesday in early October, it was a target of the kind of threat that every school official dreads."
Indiana,Q1,"Who should work at home, and who should return to the office? Companies are turning to personality tests for help. Among the many legacies of the pandemic is a new diversity in work arrangements."
Indiana,Q1,"Four states could ban transition care into young adulthood. Lawmakers in several others want to restrict drag shows in ways that could affect transgender performers broadly. It’s part of a long-term plan. Over the past three years, Republican state lawmakers have put forward a barrage of bills to regulate the lives of transgender youths, restricting the sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and medical care they can receive."
Indiana,Q1,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Indiana,Q1,"Returning to activities you’ve given up can be a surprising source of confidence and wonder. There are many reasons not to ski, and I’ve availed myself of most of them over the past two decades when asked why I gave up an activity I’d once loved. Cost was high on the list, followed by inconvenience, cold and risk to life and limb."
Indiana,Q1,"In the daily Rorschach test that is modern politics, everyone saw what they wanted in the Bidenism du jour. WASHINGTON — During a State of the Union address full of Bidenese Dictionary classics like “folks” and “I need to be crystal clear,” one entry stood out."
Indiana,Q1,"Quintessentially Californian institutions are popping up all over Manhattan as New Yorkers embrace sound baths, mocktails and legal marijuana. It’s a balmy January afternoon. You buy an avocado and pickled turnip sandwich from Gjelina and some legal weed at a high-end smoke shop. After popping by a Fred Segal boutique, you meet friends for early mocktails under the trees at San Vicente Bungalows."
Indiana,Q1,The move seeks to help more women join the work force as industry leaders complain of labor shortages. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration plans to leverage the federal government’s expansive investment in the semiconductor industry to make progress on another goal: affordable child care.
Indiana,Q1,"She died waiting for a kidney. Without urgent action, thousands more will die, too.  It’s 2019, and the 27-year-old poet and mental health activist Tonya Ingram is looking for a kidney on Instagram. Her best option is to compel someone to agree to a living donation. Where Tonya lives in California, the wait for a kidney from a deceased donor is up to 10 years. Tonya, like many on dialysis to treat kidney failure, knows the odds of her surviving the wait are slim; the median survival time for patients on dialysis is five years."
Indiana,Q1,"Also, another mass shooting in California and New Zealand’s next leader. Several top Ukrainian officials were fired yesterday amid a ballooning corruption scandal, in the biggest upheaval in President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government since the Russian invasion began."
Indiana,Q1,"Get your popcorn. Manage your expectations. The 95th Academy Awards are tomorrow. The Oscars are tomorrow night. Have you filled out your ballot? Me neither, but that’s because I am still optimistic I’ll squeeze in a few more viewings of nominated films before the red carpet begins. (That’s at 6:30 p.m. Eastern; the ceremony starts at 8. The Times’s live coverage starts in the afternoon. Don’t forget to turn your clocks forward tonight!)"
Indiana,Q1,"G.O.P. elites are simply lagging their states. My whole adult life, the work of fighting climate change was understood as the job of the blue team in America. The red team, we knew, just wasn’t going to play ball."
Indiana,Q1,"The justices found that the state’s Constitution does not include a right to the procedure, bringing an end to a monthslong legal battle. Idaho’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition on abortion in a ruling Thursday night that said the State Constitution does not include a right to the procedure."
Indiana,Q1,"The March for Life, held each year for a half-century, should be a celebration now that Roe v. Wade has fallen. Instead, anti-abortion activists are split over what comes next. For the past 20 years, Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, has traveled to Washington for the March for Life, the anti-abortion rally that marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and is held every year to urge its end."
Indiana,Q1,"Her Denver bookstore, the Tattered Cover, was among the country’s best, and she often found herself in the midst of First Amendment fights. In 1995 the writer A.E. Hotchner presented Joyce Meskis, owner of the Tattered Cover Book Store in Denver, with a PEN American Center award recognizing her efforts on behalf of freedom of speech and expression."
Indiana,Q1,"A preview for fans and non-fans alike. For many Americans, the next few days are among the most entertaining of the year. They will be filled with dozens of college basketball games, featuring major surprises and thrilling finishes. When a team loses, its season is over."
Indiana,Q1,"The question is at the heart of the human experience — and the nation’s abortion debate. An exploration through science, theology and philosophy. The question is at the heart of the human experience — and the nation’s abortion debate. An exploration through science, theology and philosophy."
Indiana,Q1,"While its leader extolled innovation and the future of tech, the bank paid less attention to risk management and was caught flat-footed by economic change. Gregory Becker, the chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank, leaned back in his chair at a technology conference last week in San Francisco’s luxurious Palace Hotel, and delivered a bullish message."
Indiana,Q1,"Boston has star players, a deep bench and recent N.B.A. finals experience. What the team won’t have, if it loses in the playoffs, will be excuses. Jayson Tatum made no guarantees for the second half of the Boston Celtics’ season but of one thing he was certain. "

Indiana,Q1,"A Supreme Court decision overturning century-old New York gun regulations has produced scores of new lawsuits as jurists and citizens sort out what’s legal. Matthew Seifer, a Long Island firearms safety instructor, is licensed by New York State to teach his students where they can legally carry their guns. It’s harder than it sounds."
Indiana,Q1,"Young people want to save for their futures, but balancing priorities has proved challenging during a time of economic instability. Shea German-Tanner tries to put a portion of her paycheck, even if it is only $50, into her savings account. But most of the time, she has to reroute the cash back to her checking to afford her expenses. Ms. German-Tanner, 22, has about $600 in her savings account right now and has not started saving for retirement."
Indiana,Q1,"In honor of the holiday, let’s look at the language of love. Of course there’s a method to the madness of conversation hearts. Long before the candies hit drugstore shelves (a seasonal harbinger of spring that I continue to appreciate), candy companies refine their messaging, dispensing with dated slang like FAX ME and introducing new terms of endearment like BAE, as Kim Severson reported in The Times this week. Once, in the late ’90s or thereabouts, I received a little pastel heart with the words DEFRAG ME printed on it. Silly, but also touching: Reorganize me, improve my performance, make me make sense."
Indiana,Q1,"Millions of people get colonoscopies each year to screen for colorectal cancer. Experts share strategies that can make the experience as smooth as possible. When patients come to me for their first colonoscopies, the first thing I usually say is, “Congratulations!” As a gastroenterologist, I applaud them for doing something important for their health and share in their joy that the hardest part of the colonoscopy process — the preparation — is behind them."
Indiana,Q1,"The railroad chief executive testified that he was “determined to make this right” but did not endorse bipartisan rail safety legislation or commit to paying for long-term damage. WASHINGTON — The chief executive of Norfolk Southern told Congress on Thursday that he was “deeply sorry” for the effects of the train derailment last month in East Palestine, Ohio, but stopped short of promising to pay for long-term damage to the community, as senators pressed him for answers about safety measures and the possible environmental consequences from the accident."
Indiana,Q1,The killings are a symptom of a deeper societal problem: the continued rise of “deaths of despair.” The killings are a symptom of a deeper societal problem: the continued rise of “deaths of despair.”
Indiana,Q1,It’s a day of uncertainty for the U.S. economy. Today is a day of uncertainty for the American economy.
Indiana,Q1,"In return for vast subsidies, the Biden administration is asking the chip industry to make promises about its workers and finances. WASHINGTON — Semiconductor manufacturers seeking a slice of nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies will need to ensure affordable child care for their workers, limit stock buybacks and share certain excess profits with the government, the Biden administration will announce on Tuesday."
Indiana,Q1,"The proposals are part of a broader push by conservative lawmakers around the country to rein in district attorneys whom they consider too liberal. ATLANTA — To Fani T. Willis, the district attorney in Atlanta, several bills in the Georgia legislature that would make it easier to remove local prosecutors are racist and perhaps retaliatory for her ongoing investigation of former President Donald J. Trump. "
Indiana,Q1,"The drumbeat of layoffs in Silicon Valley is partly a result of how the pandemic upended the economy. The layoff announcements dropped one after another, accelerating throughout the second half of 2022. Amazon began laying off what will be 18,000 employees. Lyft, the ride-share company, said it would dismiss 700 of its workers, or 13 percent of its staff. The technology giants Meta and Twitter announced that they were cutting thousands of employees."
Indiana,Q1,"Ukraine’s winter slowed the war, but there have been major developments. Going into the winter, military analysts expected that the fighting in Ukraine would slow down as wet and snowy terrain made it too difficult for either Russia or Ukraine to make major offensive pushes. Sure enough, the territorial lines have remained largely the same since a successful Ukrainian offensive in the late summer and fall."
Indiana,Q1,"The movies and the multiverse. The odds-on favorite to win best picture at this weekend’s Oscars is not the best or even second-best movie among the nominees — those would be “Tár” and “Top Gun: Maverick,” respectively — but rather a movie that a remarkable number of people just passionately loved: “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”"
Indiana,Q1,"More than offering prescriptions, suggestions — good or bad — about how we should live broaden our worldview and put us in touch with our desires. Some chapters of life attract advice. After a breakup, friends who are typically silent about your romances might urge you to get back on dating apps and block your ex on social media. Starting a family gives rise to opinions about prenatal vitamins and stroller brands; interviewing for a new job might prompt advice about salary negotiations and work-life balance."
Indiana,Q1,"Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind. The 2023 tax filing season is probably most notable for what’s missing: After three years of stimulus payments and pandemic tax breaks, nearly all of those extra benefits have faded away — and tax refunds are likely to shrink as a result."
Indiana,Q1,The anger felt by rural voters toward the Democratic Party is driving a regional realignment. Rural America has become the Republican Party’s life preserver.
Indiana,Q1,"No. 15 Princeton toppled Arizona, a No. 2 seed that was one of the favorites in the field, while No. 13 seed Furman knocked down No. 4 Virginia. SACRAMENTO — Nearly three decades after one of the most stunning upsets in N.C.A.A. history, the Princeton Tigers delivered another with a shocking 59-55 victory over second-seeded Arizona on Thursday."
Indiana,Q1,"Known as informal removals, the tactics are “off-the-book” suspensions often in violation of federal civil rights protections for those with disabilities. ROSEBURG, Ore. — Jessica LaVigne was nervous but hopeful on a recent afternoon that the team managing her son’s special education plan at Roseburg High School would tell her something she had dreamed of for more than a decade: He would be able to attend a full day of school for the first time since second grade."
Indiana,Q1,"24 comics, paintings, photos, drawings and collages tell a nuanced story. What can you show us that might help explain what it’s like to be a teenager right now?"
Indiana,Q2,"Mr. Pence is a once-loyal vice president who became a target of Trump supporters, and an evangelical Christian whose faith drives his hard-line opposition to abortion. Over the past eight years, Mike Pence has gone from being a skeptic of Donald J. Trump to his doggedly loyal vice president to the target of his strongest supporters during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Now he is one of a growing number of Mr. Trump’s opponents in the Republican presidential primary."
Indiana,Q2,"Gratitude ceremonies give students and faculty members a chance to recognize the sacrifice of those who gave their bodies for medical research and education, and the loved ones they left behind. A solemn gathering at Columbia University last month had the trappings of a traditional memorial service. Students and faculty members performed music and gave speeches. The university’s chaplain closed the ceremony with a reflection."
Indiana,Q2,"A flurry of debuts. The return of Sara Mearns. Performances that lingered after the curtain fell. Here are the highlights from a packed spring season. If New York City Ballet’s spring season could be bottled into a fragrance, it would be fresh and green, with the earthy, sweet scent of a breeze after a bout of rain. How did we get here? The company, seemingly all of a sudden, looks so strong, and more important, so light. The high fives passed from one dancer to the next as they crossed the stage in Alexei Ratmansky’s “Namouna” seemed more funny, more victorious and more true than ever."
Indiana,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Indiana,Q2,"Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature prioritized a number of measures restricting transgender rights during this year’s session that ended on Friday. The Florida Legislature passed a bill on Thursday that would prohibit gender-transition care for minors and restrict it for adults, one of several measures aimed at L.G.B.T.Q. communities that have been passed during this year’s legislative session. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican crisscrossing the country as he tests a possible 2024 presidential run, is expected to sign it into law."

That means abortion will remain legal in Iowa through 20 weeks of pregnancy."

Indiana,Q2,"The names of Nazi-era doctors are still found on diseases and body parts. By expunging them, will doctors forget lessons of the past? Edith Sheffer’s young son always disliked labels such as Asperger’s syndrome. But in 2016, a psychiatrist told him that he should be proud: His condition was named after Dr. Hans Asperger, an Austrian scientist in the 1930s who used his position to help save children like him. By devising a diagnosis that emphasized the children’s intellectual abilities, the psychiatrist said, Dr. Asperger tried to spare them from the Nazi campaign to “euthanize” youths with cognitive disabilities."

RALEIGH, N.C. — People who watch politics in North Carolina say that Phil Berger, a Republican who calls himself a fiscal conservative and a “social traditionalist,” is the most powerful man in the state. For years, as the top Republican in the State Senate, he blocked North Carolina from expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act."

While the company claimed its beverage would “give you wings,” it never said it was actually good for people."

The gunman, who used an AR-15-style rifle and livestreamed the attack, was killed by the police after exchanging fire with them."
Indiana,Q2,"Black Lives Matter protests reduce police violence. Homicides have risen. How do we make sense of it all? A couple of years ago, Travis Campbell, an economics professor at Southern Oregon University, published a study showing that from 2014 to 2019, Black Lives Matter protests “meaningfully reduced” police homicides. Those years saw urban protests prompted by the Aug. 9, 2014, shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the April 12, 2015, death in police custody of Freddie Gray in Baltimore."

Indiana,Q2,"After abortion rights supporters swept six ballot measures last year, Republican legislatures seek to make it harder to get on the ballot, and harder to win if there is a vote.

Indiana,Q3,"Badly hurt, a 68-year-old solo traveler expected her insurer to coordinate her care, provide much-needed translation services and then return her home to Florida. Was she expecting too much? I’m a 68-year-old solo traveler who was on a tour of Sicily in June 2022, when I fell getting off a bus, breaking multiple ribs, vertebrae and a pelvic bone. I had purchased the RoundTrip Choice plan from Seven Corners Travel Insurance, so I called, expecting they would help coordinate my medical care with Italian-speaking doctors. But they told me to seek help on my own, save the receipts and file a claim when I got home. Our tour guide was an angel, arranging drivers to take me back and forth to the hospital and even interpreting by speakerphone with doctors. Days later I got a doctor to fill out a form (which I had to Google Translate for him) saying I could travel home, as long as I was in a reclining position. My family chipped in to buy a business-class seat for the return flight, a day-and-night trip from Palermo to Munich to New York to Jacksonville. Seven Corners finally paid $5,772 for my bills and missed trip, but refused to reimburse me for most of my business-class fare. Far worse, I believe they failed to provide me the assistance they promised, essentially leaving me to fend for myself and leaving me unable to communicate with hospital staff. I have registered complaints with the Better Business Bureau and the state insurance agencies of Florida and Indiana (where Seven Corners is based), but I’ve gotten nowhere. Can you help? Helaine, St. Augustine, Fla."

Indiana,Q3,"In rare cases, tests are being used to investigate the outcomes of pregnancies in a country where abortion is effectively banned. Nearly three years ago, Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal effectively ended legal abortion in the country.

Authorities have violently dispersed demonstrations, threatened activists with prison time and ordered doctors to record all pregnancies in a new national database."
Indiana,Q3,"From meatpackers to home health aides, workers are struggling in sweltering temperatures and productivity is taking a hit.

He was 86."
Indiana,Q3,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is getting a lot of play, but his views are in the minority. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, vaccine skepticism has been back in the headlines. Though Kennedy has said he isn’t anti-vaccine and that his children have had vaccines, and his campaign manager (the former Democratic congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich) says calling Kennedy “anti-vax” is a “left-handed smear,” Kennedy continues to suggest a link between vaccines and autism — a link that has leaned heavily on flawed and retracted science. He’s also been a vocal opponent of Covid vaccines."

Indiana,Q3,"For couples in long-term relationships, the “bristle reaction” can make physical connection difficult, experts say. A few years ago, Vanessa Marin, a sex therapist in Santa Barbara, Calif., noticed an interesting pattern among her clients in long-term relationships: They would complain that their partners only touched them to initiate sex. The gesture, a back rub or a playful grab, would make them flinch."
Indiana,Q3,"He headed the journalism program at Harvard after overseeing Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Kent State shootings and corruption in Michigan. Robert H. Giles, who oversaw Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage at two newspapers — including reports on the fatal shooting of four antiwar protesters by National Guard troops on the Kent State University campus in Ohio in 1970 — and later served as curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University for more than a decade, died on Aug. 7 in Traverse City, Mich.

Indiana,Q3,"Group running has exploded in New York City. As friendships, marriages and even rivalries emerge, the benefits are proving as social as they are physical. On a Thursday evening in early September, the Upper West Side Run Club met on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan.

Indiana,Q3,"With their contract expiring Sept. 14, the United Auto Workers and the companies are far apart in talks. A walkout could take a big economic toll.

Indiana,Q3,"The former vice president’s time in the spotlight at the debate did not lift his position in the polls, where he continues to languish in the low-single digits. Mike Pence sat on Wednesday in a cavernous machine shop that was humming with activity as he preached old-time Republican religion: the dangers of the swelling national debt, the need to overhaul Social Security and Medicare, the perils of price controls on prescription drugs and the necessity of projecting military might across the globe."

Indiana,Q3,"Arizona is used to scorching summers, but the region’s long stretch of days with 110-degree temperatures is straining patience and resources.

Indiana,Q3,"Dozens of players were caught up in the lies and false promises of Bishop Sycamore and Christians of Faith Academy. One player made it out to play major college football.

Indiana,Q3,"Originally published on Dec. 1, 2018 More and more, we live in bubbles. Most of us are surrounded by people who look like us, vote like us, earn like us, spend money like us, have educations like us and worship like us. The result is an empathy deficit, and it’s at the root of many of our biggest problems. It’s because of how homogeneous people’s social circles have become, and also because humans naturally hold biases. But researchers have discovered that far from being an immutable trait, empathy can be developed. There are steps people can take to acknowledge their biases and to move beyond their own worldviews to try to understand those held by other people. Bonus: You’ll make new friends along the way."
Indiana,Q3,"It started as a chronicler of all things downtown. After success came, it morphed into something else. Now Paper has a new owner — and an uncertain future.

Indiana,Q3,How you view the crisis of men and boys — and whether you think there is one — is just one of the ways you reveal your political leanings. Competing partisan views on how we see men and masculinity are emerging as key factors in the run-up to the 2024 election.
Indiana,Q3,"Proud resistance is our secret birthright. The striking miners were 10,000 strong on the first day of September 1921 as they charged up the slope of Blair Mountain, propelled by a radical faith in the American dream. According to an Associated Press reporter who crouched behind a log and watched through field glasses, each time they pressed forward, a “veritable wall” of machine gun fire drove them back. As the barrage echoed through the hollows, reminding some of the action they had just seen in the forests of France, the advancing miners soon heard a different sound: deeper, earthshaking explosions. From biplanes above, tear gas, explosive powder and metal bolts rained down. “My God,” screamed one miner fighting his way up Crooked Creek Gap. “They’re bombing us!”"
Indiana,Q3,"New research reveals the vast scope of the Native American boarding school system, which for more than a century removed Native children from their homes and families in an effort to assimilate them. Students at the schools gave up their names, their labor and sometimes their lives.

Students at the schools gave up their names, their labor and sometimes their lives."
Indiana,Q4,"The president’s push to focus attention on the domestic economy comes as his administration has been dealing with events overseas after the terrorist attacks in Israel. President Biden on Wednesday began a tour of rural communities at a Minnesota hog farm where he lamented the loss of family farms, attacked the corporate consolidation of agriculture and pledged to oversee a renaissance of the American heartland."
Indiana,Q4,"The divisions are erupting as the House weighs a G.O.P. bid to censure the only Palestinian-American member of Congress for criticizing Israel and votes on a large aid bill to back Israel in the war in Gaza. Israel’s war against Hamas is exposing deep divisions among Democrats in Congress, as the most outspoken supporters of the Jewish state and vocal pro-Palestinian members on the left trade accusations of bigotry and feud over what role the United States should play in the hostilities."
Indiana,Q4,"A lower court is now expected to hear arguments on the broader question of whether the right to privacy in the state constitution protects a right to abortion. Georgia’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition of abortion Tuesday, rejecting arguments made by doctors and advocacy groups that the law was unconstitutional when the state legislature approved it in 2019, more than three years before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade."
Indiana,Q4,Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 47 percent to 45 percent among the likely electorate. Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 47 percent to 45 percent among the likely electorate.
Indiana,Q4,"In candy shades and eggy shapes, many of today’s most popular vaping devices look like toys. Experts worry they will hook a new generation of users. Alexa Addison remembers what vapes looked like when she was in high school. The dominant e-cigarette was Juul, a slim, black rectangle with sharp corners that resembled a flash drive."
Indiana,Q4,"Everyone else is having more sex than you. Men want sex more than women do. And more. Chalk it up to the variability in sex education, in high schools and even medical schools, or to the fact that many adults find it hard to talk about sex with the person who regularly sees them naked. Whatever the reason, misinformation about sexuality and desire is common."
Indiana,Q4,Donald Trump leads Joe Biden by 46 percent to 44 percent among registered voters. Donald Trump leads Joe Biden by 46 percent to 44 percent among registered voters.
Indiana,Q4,"Long before Florida Man became a meme, he mined the Sunshine State’s weirdness for enough material to fill 26 darkly funny crime novels. Tim Dorsey, who drew on his years as a crime reporter to fuel a second career writing a long series of darkly comic thrillers set along the back roads and back alleys of Florida’s weird, wild underbelly, died on Sunday at his home in Islamorada, a town in the Florida Keys. He was 62."
Indiana,Q4,"Ballot questions have been a winning strategy for abortion rights, even in red states. But complicated ballot language and misinformation have some abortion rights supporters worried. Follow our live updates from Election Day 2023."
Indiana,Q4,The State Constitution will protect access to the procedure. The ballot result sends a strong signal that voters are still angry about the demise of Roe. Ohio’s resounding approval of a ballot measure enshrining a right to abortion in the State Constitution continued a winning streak for abortion-rights groups that have appealed directly to voters after the demise of Roe v. Wade.
Indiana,Q4,"The United Automobile Workers reported improved wage offers from the automakers and a concession from General Motors on workers at battery factories. The United Automobile Workers union said on Friday that it had made progress in its negotiations with Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, and would not expand the strikes against the companies that began three weeks ago."
Indiana,Q4,"In the wake of a controversy at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard over antisemitism, a debate has arisen over whether academics are best suited to lead big schools. After weeks of criticism from alumni, donors and public officials — and disastrous testimony on Capitol Hill — Liz Magill stepped down as the University of Pennsylvania’s president on Saturday over her stance on combating antisemitism. Meanwhile, the heads of Harvard and M.I.T. remain under pressure, with some of their fiercest critics continuing to call for them to resign, too."
Indiana,Q4,"A preview of an upcoming vote on abortion access in Ohio. On Tuesday, Ohio voters will decide whether to protect access to abortion in their state."
Indiana,Q4,"The race is on to put hotels in space and neighborhoods on the moon. Here’s some of what we know about how Earthlings fare beyond the safety of our home world. As an incubator of life, Earth has a lot going for it, something we often fail to appreciate fully from within its nurturing bounds. Merely sending probes and rovers to the moon and Mars won’t do. For various reasons — adventure! apocalypse! commerce! — we insist upon taking our corporeal selves off-world too. Multiple private companies have announced plans to put hotels in space soon. NASA is aiming to 3-D-print lunar neighborhoods within a couple of decades. And while it will probably take longer than that to build and populate an outpost on Mars, preparations are being made: This summer, four NASA crew members began a 378-day stay in simulated Martian housing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston."
Indiana,Q4,"Wednesday’s four-hour meeting in San Francisco resulted in few breakthroughs. But C.E.O.s gave the Chinese leader a standing ovation at a banquet afterward. The mood music was upbeat but pragmatic after the first face-to-face meeting in a year between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. There was no joint communiqué after Wednesday’s talks, but both sides issued positive statements trumpeting where they found common ground, including on tackling climate change and improving communications."
Indiana,Q4,"The Natural Resources Defense Council is eliminating its longstanding program promoting nuclear safety and cleanup as donors focus on the climate crisis. A significant shift in donor contributions to nonprofits fighting climate change in recent years has left some of the nation’s biggest environmental organizations facing critical shortfalls in programs on toxic chemicals, radioactive contamination and wildlife protection."
Indiana,Q4,"My husband and I haven’t spoken in more than a year. It can’t go on like this, but it will. My husband and I are going through a really difficult time in our marriage, and there doesn’t seem to be a lot of advice for how to proceed. We haven’t spoken in more than a year. When the children ask where he is, I don’t know what to say. I have had to take over all the household tasks, plus a lot of legal and financial paperwork. I’ve had a lot of time to reflect on all the things I’ve done wrong, but I can’t apologize."
Indiana,Q4,"Overturning Roe changed politics. Overturning affirmative action did not. What do the strikingly different public responses to two recent Supreme Court rulings — one on abortion, the other on affirmative action — suggest about the prospects for the liberal agenda?"
Indiana,Q4,"Life expectancy averages may be falling, but you might not have been able to tell that from reading the obituaries about many luminaries this year. In February 1961, The New York Times, citing a study by the American Medical Association, ran a brief article reporting that Americans could very well enjoy a life expectancy of 120 years during the 21st century."
Indiana,Q4,"Pro-Palestinian students say that they are speaking up for an oppressed people, but critics say that their rhetoric is deeply offensive. In the days after the Hamas attack on Israel, Max Strozenberg, a first-year student at Northwestern University, experienced a couple of jarring incidents."
Indiana,Q4,Leaders from around the world explained how they took their passions and concerns and turned them into action. A financial administrator with deteriorating sight seeks help at an advocacy organization for visually impaired people and rises to become its chief executive. A former government spokeswoman with a love of cooking starts a restaurant to train refugees in culinary skills. A Lao weaver hoping to preserve a traditional craft creates a way to support it. Seven women from around the world explain how they took their passions and concerns and turned them into action. The interviews were edited and condensed.
Indiana,Q4,"A chat with Will Shortz, who has been editing The Times’s puzzle for 30 years. Will Shortz celebrated his 30th anniversary as The Times’s Crossword editor this week. He is one of only four Crossword editors since 1942, when the paper began publishing puzzles as a way to offer relief to readers overwhelmed by war news. “It is possible there will now be bleak blackout hours — or if not that then certainly a need for relaxation of some kind or other,” Lester Markel, the paper’s Sunday editor, wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor."

Indiana,Q4,
Iowa,Q1,"Responding to concerns about student privacy, high school athletics officials voted to remove questions about menstruation history from a medical form. Florida’s governing body for high school sports voted on Thursday to remove all questions about menstruation from medical forms required for student athletes, after an uproar that reflected anxieties about digital and reproductive privacy."
Iowa,Q1,"The group, the MAGA Inc. super PAC, accused Gov. Ron DeSantis of violating Florida laws by operating a shadow presidential campaign. A DeSantis spokeswoman called it a politically motivated attack. Donald J. Trump spent much of the past year teasing a presidential campaign, telling New York magazine last summer that he had “already made that decision” on whether to run and promising his rally crowds for months that they would be “very happy” about his choice."
Iowa,Q1,"The government will strictly limit in drinking water two chemicals that are ubiquitous in modern society but are linked to a range of health effects. WASHINGTON — For the first time, the federal government will require utilities to remove from drinking water two toxic chemicals found in everything from waterproof clothing to dental floss and even toilet paper, the Environmental Protection Agency announced on Tuesday."
Iowa,Q1,"The law is the only one in the nation to prohibit the use separate from an overall abortion ban and is part of a growing effort by conservative states to target the pills. Wyoming on Friday became the first state to explicitly ban the use of pills for abortion, adding momentum to a growing push by conservative states and anti-abortion groups to target medication abortion, the method now used in a majority of pregnancy terminations in the United States."
Iowa,Q1,"The first time Gary Allinger spotted JR Duran, in late 2007, he was immediately smitten, but it would take many more months before they would finally connect. An incorrect email was to blame. Gary LeRoy Allinger and Onofre Duran, who is known as JR, first spotted each other during a bus tour of bars in Las Vegas that each had taken in December 2007."
Iowa,Q1,"Virginia’s Republican governor is considering a presidential run, but a divided state legislature may thwart his ambitions for conservative policy victories. VIRGINIA BEACH — Gov. Glenn Youngkin headlined a rally on Saturday outside the red-brick City Hall here, urging voters to back a fellow Virginia Republican in a special election for State Senate."
Iowa,Q1,"A preview for fans and non-fans alike. For many Americans, the next few days are among the most entertaining of the year. They will be filled with dozens of college basketball games, featuring major surprises and thrilling finishes. When a team loses, its season is over."
Iowa,Q1,"The legislative calendar is packed with 300 abortion bills. “You can’t go to jail for screwing up an appendectomy,” one lawmaker said. For the first time since the fight over abortion access was kicked to the states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, newly elected legislatures around the country are coming into session and are putting the polarizing issue at the top of their agendas. Around 300 bills in 40 states have been proposed so far — with a majority seeking to restrict access to abortion, and others trying to strengthen it."
Iowa,Q1,"Returning to activities you’ve given up can be a surprising source of confidence and wonder. There are many reasons not to ski, and I’ve availed myself of most of them over the past two decades when asked why I gave up an activity I’d once loved. Cost was high on the list, followed by inconvenience, cold and risk to life and limb."
Iowa,Q1,"The chain’s situation shows the complicated legal and reputational landscape that it and its competitors must navigate in the post-Roe era. Walgreens landed at the center of a consumer and political firestorm in recent days, after saying it would not dispense an abortion pill in 21 states where Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action against pharmacies that try to distribute the medication."
Iowa,Q1,"President Biden said his budget was designed to “lift the burden on hard working Americans” and drew sharp contrasts with the proposals that Republicans have offered. President Biden released a $6.8 trillion budget proposal on Thursday that would reduce the deficit, raise taxes on the rich, bolster military spending and ramp up competition with China."
Iowa,Q1,"The marquee committee of the new Republican majority opened its first hearing by rehashing complaints about the treatment of former President Donald J. Trump and others. Even Fox News cut away. WASHINGTON — When hard-right Republicans extracted concessions from Speaker Kevin McCarthy in exchange for supporting his election last month, one of their top demands was that he robustly fund and give sweeping jurisdiction to a special subcommittee to investigate their claims of pervasive bias in the federal government against conservatives."
Iowa,Q1,"Activists are pushing for tougher abortion restrictions, while politicians fear turning off swing voters who don’t support strict limits like a national ban. For decades, opposition to abortion was a crucial but relatively clear-cut litmus test for Republican candidates: support overturning a constitutional right to an abortion, back anti-abortion judges and vote against taxpayer funding for the procedure."
Iowa,Q1,"Some of the highest-profile complaints show how America’s culture wars are affecting the nation’s children. WASHINGTON — The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights logged a record number of discrimination complaints in the past year, the latest indicator of how the social and political strife roiling the country is reverberating in the nation’s schools."
Iowa,Q1,"Many of the legal arguments seeking to overturn abortion bans rely on rights provided by the states, and how they are interpreted by state supreme courts. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in June, it declared that it was sending the issue back to the “people and their elected representatives.” But the fight has largely moved to a different set of supreme courts and constitutions: those in the states."
Iowa,Q1,"The former president, who relied on evangelical voters in 2016, has accused Christian leaders of “disloyalty” and blamed them for Republicans’ disappointing midterm performance. On Sunday, the Rev. Robert Jeffress, a longtime supporter of Donald J. Trump who has yet to endorse his 2024 White House bid, shared the stage at his Dallas megachurch with one of the former president’s potential rivals next year: former Vice President Mike Pence."

Iowa,Q1,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Iowa,Q1,"Joe Biden’s age has loomed over his presidency. He was right before about himself. Where stability and risk meet, he’s potentially asking people to again trust him. In February 2020, just before the world shut down, I was waiting for Joe Biden to speak on a Friday night in Henderson, Nev. The next morning I watched Bernie Sanders rally a fairly young, largely Latino crowd in a packed Las Vegas high school cafeteria. The Biden event, held when it looked as if he would not win the nomination, was smaller and more subdued. On the other side of a rope separating the media from attendees, a few Biden supporters were talking about how stressful it would be to be president at their and Mr. Biden’s age. As I remember it, one of them said, “But he feels he has to do it.”"
Iowa,Q1,"G.O.P. elites are simply lagging their states. My whole adult life, the work of fighting climate change was understood as the job of the blue team in America. The red team, we knew, just wasn’t going to play ball."
Iowa,Q1,"Safety experts say a focus on financial returns may be partly to blame for derailments and accidents like the one in Ohio. Last month, as Norfolk Southern, one of the largest railroads in North America, reported record operating profits, Alan H. Shaw, its chief executive, told shareholders that the company’s service was “at the best it’s been in more than two years.”"
Iowa,Q1,"It is not what he says when he’s on the air. On Tuesday evening, two news reports caught my attention. The first was an Emerson College poll of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire. Donald Trump holds an incredible 41-point lead over Ron DeSantis in the state that rescued Trump’s primary campaign after a second-place finish in Iowa in 2016. This result is in line with a series of national polls that also show Trump with a large lead over DeSantis. Trump is still the favorite to win the G.O.P. nomination. Any other conclusion at this early date is wishful thinking."
Iowa,Q1,"They got lost in this weird moment, where the world is caught between crisis and normalcy, nostalgic for house parties — and Houseparty, too. One day last year, Julie Gauthier went on Twitter with a confession to make. “Unpopular opinion: I don’t have zoom fatigue and I miss zoom happy hours and game nights,” she wrote. “I feel more isolated now than I did when friends all took time to chat online at the beginning of the pandemic.”"
Iowa,Q1,"He was a decorated soldier, a whistle-blower against torture. Then he was undone by his own mind — and a health care system that utterly failed him. Ian Fishback allowed the police officer to slip handcuffs around his wrists. It was Sept. 10, 2021, beside the Diag, the central plaza on the University of Michigan’s main campus in Ann Arbor, and Fishback, a recent graduate of a Michigan doctoral program and among the most prominent veterans of the American war in Iraq, was in a dizzying mental-health descent. Earlier in the day, a judge updated a court order giving police officers the authority to return him involuntarily to psychiatric care. He had been roaming campus intermittently for a week, shouting profanities at bystanders, creating a disturbance at the Wolverines’ opening football game, insulting police officers and raging about the U.S. Army and the C.I.A. He was already known to the university’s public-safety department, which had investigated complaints about him since at least 2019. Soon a caller notified the department that he was yelling at students again. The last time he was detained, in June, Fishback screamed at sheriff deputies that the Constitution doesn’t exist and bolted, only to be brought to the ground and shackled in belly restraints. Now he had no more fight. "
Iowa,Q1,The anger felt by rural voters toward the Democratic Party is driving a regional realignment. Rural America has become the Republican Party’s life preserver.
Iowa,Q1,"After a crime surge, Chicago voters have ousted their current mayor. Chicago’s mayor race has joined the growing list of evidence that Americans are unhappy about crime."
Iowa,Q1,"The president requested trillions in new spending that has no chance of passing a Republican House, even as he sought to reduce deficits by raising taxes on businesses and the rich. WASHINGTON — President Biden on Thursday proposed a $6.8 trillion budget that sought to increase spending on the military and a wide range of new social programs while also reducing future budget deficits, defying Republican calls to scale back government and reasserting his economic vision before an expected re-election campaign."
Iowa,Q1,"Like everything else, spring has its adherents and detractors. I like to be up when it’s dark in the morning, to move sleepily around in the dark, working and sipping coffee and listening to music undistracted. I keep the lights off, which keeps the visual noise off. Outside, only the moon, maybe one neighbor’s television flashing blue and green on the living room wall."
Iowa,Q1,"The administration faced a conservative court that has insisted that government initiatives with major political and economic consequences be clearly authorized by Congress. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed deeply skeptical on Tuesday of the legality of the Biden administration’s plan to wipe out more than $400 billion in student debt, heightening the prospect that the justices would thwart efforts to forgive the loans of tens of millions of borrowers."
Iowa,Q1,"Officials are worried that a few banks’ collapse is only the beginning. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and others — and the government’s rescue over the weekend — left many of us again rushing to understand the arcane details of the financial system. It can be maddeningly complex, so I want to use today’s newsletter to explain some of the basics."
Iowa,Q1,The killings are a symptom of a deeper societal problem: the continued rise of “deaths of despair.” The killings are a symptom of a deeper societal problem: the continued rise of “deaths of despair.”
Iowa,Q1,"“It’s important not to overstate the damage that some perceive liberalism as having done to the Democrats’ electoral fortunes,” one scholar says. Over the past four decades, the percentage of white Democrats who identify themselves as liberal has more than doubled, growing at a much faster pace than Black or Hispanic Democrats."
Iowa,Q1,"How the downfall of one intelligence agent revealed the astonishing depth of Chinese industrial espionage. In March 2017, an engineer at G.E. Aviation in Cincinnati whom I will refer to using part of his Chinese given name — Hua — received a request on LinkedIn. Hua is in his 40s, tall and athletic, with a boyish face that makes him look a decade younger. He moved to the United States from China in 2003 for graduate studies in structural engineering. After earning his Ph.D. in 2007, he went to work for G.E., first at the company’s research facility in Niskayuna, N.Y., for a few years, then at G.E. Aviation."

Iowa,Q1,
Iowa,Q2,"A worrisome scarcity of cancer drugs has heightened concerns about the troubled generic drug industry. Congress and the White House are seeking ways to address widespread supply problems. Thousands of patients are facing delays in getting treatments for cancer and other life-threatening diseases, with drug shortages in the United States approaching record levels."
Iowa,Q2,"The G.O.P. has a twisted view of the safety net. Work requirements for federal assistance programs do not, well, work."
Iowa,Q2,"Democrats are vowing to make abortion rights a pillar of their campaigns, while Republicans are caught between their conservative base and a public that generally backs access to the procedure. Nearly a year after the Supreme Court turned abortion into a dominant issue of the 2022 midterms, the battle over abortion rights has catapulted to the center of the emerging 2024 election season, igniting Democrats, dividing Republicans and turbocharging sensitive debates over health care."
Iowa,Q2,"The Republican presidential candidate has made inaccurate or misleading claims about abortion, trans youth, foreign policy and domestic issues. Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, was the first prominent candidate to announce a challenge to former President Donald J. Trump’s bid for the Republican presidential nomination."
Iowa,Q2,"Drug dealers are mixing xylazine, an animal tranquilizer relied on by veterinarians, into fentanyl, with deadly results. But controlling it is tricky. Penny, a 3-year-old sorrel mare with a white blaze, had been slobbering her feed and fighting her bit, signs of a likely toothache. An exam confirmed that she needed two wolf teeth extracted and the sharp edges of some molars ground down, procedures that required propping her jaws open with a speculum."
Iowa,Q2,"Mr. Ramaswamy calls himself a scientist from the biotech industry, but his vast fortune stems from two huge paydays that speak to hope and hype in the world of finance. On the campaign trail, as he lays out why he is a different kind of presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy calls himself a Harvard-trained “scientist” from the lifesaving world of biotechnology."
Iowa,Q2,"The legislation, which includes an exemption for people already receiving treatment, now goes to the desk of the Republican governor. In the waning days of their legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday that would ban transition care for transgender youth."
Iowa,Q2,"The C.D.C. traced deaths and cases of blindness to products imported from India. The agency said it was concerned that the bacteria could gain a foothold in the U.S. A highly drug-resistant bacteria that was linked to eyedrops imported from India and that spread from person to person in a Connecticut long-term care center has prompted concerns that the strain could gain a foothold in U.S. health care settings, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Iowa,Q2,"With single-party statehouse control at its highest level in decades, legislators across much of the country leaned into cultural issues and bulldozed the opposition. America’s state capitals are as polarized as they have been in decades, with lawmakers imposing unflinchingly conservative or liberal agendas this year, even in politically diverse places."
Iowa,Q2,For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted. For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted.
Iowa,Q2,"Farmers face an elevated risk of suicide. After Brenda Statz’s husband, Leon, lost his battle with depression, she is trying to spare others from his fate. LOGANVILLE, Wis. — Brenda Statz remembers the rain on the day they lost Leon, her husband of 34 years. The deluge had fallen for weeks, flooding their fields, delaying the harvest, pounding the roof of the barn where Mr. Statz finished his morning chores, then ended his life."
Iowa,Q2,"Miriam Jordan, The Times’s national immigration correspondent, is covering a major shift in border policy this week. As an international correspondent for Reuters and The Wall Street Journal, Miriam Jordan reported from India, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico and Brazil. When she returned to the United States in 2004, she found a way to keep her reporting global: by covering immigration. Her experience and language skills (besides English, Ms. Jordan speaks Spanish, Portuguese, French and Hebrew) were well-suited to the beat."
Iowa,Q2,"In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities. In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities."
Iowa,Q2,"The key to a successful legal campaign is realizing that gender freedom benefits everyone. Transgender Americans are under attack. Across the country, Republicans have introduced an avalanche of legislation to restrict access to gender-affirming health care, censor how gender is discussed in schools, prevent trans people from using public bathrooms and even ban drag shows and cross-dressing onstage. In March, Tennessee criminalized drag performances where children are present. In April, Montana Republicans barred Representative Zooey Zephyr from the floor of the state House in part for her vocal opposition to a similar bill, which is now headed to the governor’s desk."
Iowa,Q2,"Working from home isn’t as common as at the pandemic’s start, but experts agree it’s here to stay. When the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the U.S. economy three years ago, workers and their employers adjusted astonishingly well to what came to be called W.F.H. — work from home. Workers liked working from home for the most part, but many employers were cool toward it, and ever since the threat of the virus waned, they have been trying to get their people to R.T.O. — return to office."
Iowa,Q2,"The presidential candidate went on the daytime talk show to debate his views about systemic racism. But it was his comments about L.G.B.T.Q. rights that got boos from the audience. The chatty daytime talk show “The View” might seem like an unlikely platform for Tim Scott, a senator from South Carolina and a presidential candidate, to get his footing with Republican primary voters, but he saw an opening on Monday and tried to make the most of it."
Iowa,Q2,"Critics say a fierce law-and-order approach could undermine public health goals and advances in addiction treatment. Three teenage girls were found slumped in a car in the parking lot of a rural Tennessee high school last month, hours before graduation ceremonies. Two were dead from fentanyl overdoses. The third, a 17-year-old, was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Two days later, she was charged with the girls’ murders."
Iowa,Q2,"Casey DeSantis has advised her husband on media strategy and taken on some of the state’s big issues. The presidential campaign trail is next. During a recent appearance in South Carolina, after Ron DeSantis played up his state’s economic and education policies and bashed a litany of ideological adversaries, his wife settled into an armchair next to him onstage, reflecting on her role as the first lady of Florida."
Iowa,Q2,"The bipartisan debt limit deal still isn’t assured of passing. Can House Republicans behave as the members of a well-functioning political party would? Or are they still the same party that has cycled through one House leader after another over the past decade, unable to find one who can unite various factions?"
Iowa,Q2,"This is not what Franklin Roosevelt had in mind. On Tuesday, Republicans in North Carolina overrode Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto to pass a strict limit on bodily autonomy in the form of a 12-week abortion ban."
Iowa,Q2,"The former South Carolina governor, who also served as United Nations ambassador under Donald Trump, emphasized her experience and vision. Will it be enough for her to stand out? Nikki Haley, who was the first prominent Republican to announce a challenge to former President Donald J. Trump in the 2024 race, has yet to see her presidential campaign catch fire. On Sunday night, she had a fresh opportunity to make the case for her candidacy during a 90-minute CNN town hall in prime time, in an effort to emerge from the low single digits in polls where she has been mired."
Iowa,Q2,"Lead, bacteria and PFAS are among the contaminants cropping up in drinking water. Over the past few years, water safety crises have cropped up in several cities, including Baltimore, Flint, Mich., Jackson, Miss., and Newark, N.J., where lead or bacteria have leached into tap water, forcing people to rely on bottled water or on boiling their tap water to rid it of pathogens. In New York City, a recent report estimated that one in five people may be drinking lead-contaminated water."
Iowa,Q2,"A life in Congress comes with power, prestige and perks that can be hard to leave behind. For some lawmakers who view their job as their identity, the prospect is unthinkable. Former Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, has put on a suit nine times since 2014, when he retired after serving in Congress for 40 years. He counts."
Iowa,Q2,"Focusing heavily on Florida at his first town-hall event in the Granite State, Ron DeSantis drew a reception that was sometimes warm, sometimes more skeptical — especially on the issue of abortion. At his first town-hall event in New Hampshire, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida talked on Tuesday about illegal immigration in Texas, crime in Chicago, disorder on the streets of San Francisco and the wonders of nearly every aspect of Florida — a state he mentioned about 80 times."
Iowa,Q2,The Minneapolis Police Department is facing sweeping overhauls after the release of a multiyear investigation into its practices by the Justice Department. The Minneapolis Police Department is facing sweeping overhauls after the release of a multiyear investigation into its practices by the Justice Department.
Iowa,Q2,"California women have shattered some significant glass ceilings. But alongside all those famous firsts are some lingering imbalances in the state’s power structure. California women have shattered some significant glass ceilings: Nancy Pelosi, the first female House speaker; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, the first all-female delegation to the U.S. Senate; Kamala Harris, the nation’s first female vice president."
Iowa,Q2,"Vivek Ramaswamy, a long-shot 2024 contender, is lavishly wealthy and astoundingly confident. He also promises to exert breathtaking power in ways that Donald Trump never did. Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican wunderkind running for his party’s presidential nomination, would like potential supporters to know he believes in the rule of law and the Constitution’s separation of powers — though his applications of such principles can seem selective."
Iowa,Q2,"As the Florida governor hopscotched the country preparing to run for president, a Michigan nonprofit paid the bills. It won’t say where it got the money. For Ron DeSantis, Sunday, Feb. 19, was the start of another busy week of not officially running for president."
Iowa,Q2,"The battle for a state Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a microcosm of the country. It is narrowly divided politically, though Democrats have a slight advantage in the popular vote in statewide elections. And, as in Washington, Republicans have structural advantages in the government that give them outsize power."
Iowa,Q2,"The organized movement to ban books in schools is betraying the young people it claims to protect. Last year, a parent at a Virginia school board meeting stepped up to a microphone and read a passage from my book, “Sold.” The scene she chose to read, informed in part by my own experiences of sexual abuse, describes the sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl by an older man. There is no graphic language or obscenity in the passage; the story is told from the point of view of a child — in the words of a child — and conveys her confusion, terror and physical pain."
Iowa,Q2,"What is the relationship, if any, between states requiring that abstinence is stressed in sex education and states restricting access to abortion? On July 22, 2022, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. Two weeks before this verdict, The Times Opinion section published the map above. "
Iowa,Q2,"As cognitive decline began to alter who Diane Norelius was, her adult daughters and her boyfriend wound up in a bitter dispute over which version of her should get to decide what she wanted. In October 2017, Diane Norelius stopped answering the phone. Her two daughters called and called. They called Diane’s boyfriend, Denzil Nelson, too. Whenever Denzil picked up, he would only say, “She doesn’t want to talk to you.” But usually, he didn’t pick up. The women worried that their mother, who was 81, was sick, or maybe even dead. After a few days of radio silence, they flew home to Denison, Iowa, a town of around 8,000 people, surrounded by cornfields."
Iowa,Q2,"President Biden said he would meet with lawmakers on May 9 to discuss ways to avoid a default. WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Monday that the United States could run out of money to pay its bills by June 1 if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit, putting pressure on President Biden and lawmakers to reach a swift agreement to avoid defaulting on the nation’s debt."
Iowa,Q2,"The polls say the former vice president, who announced his 2024 candidacy in a video on Wednesday, has little chance. But he is driven by his faith. Mike Pence is the most conservative candidate competing for the presidency. The former vice president wants abortion banned from the point of conception. He’s the only major candidate calling for cuts to Social Security and Medicare. And he has the most hawkish foreign policy, especially on confronting Russia."
Iowa,Q2,"Federal law has put thousands of women on anti-addiction medications into an impossible bind: Give up your treatment or risk losing your baby. One morning in the summer of 2020, Jade Dass woke up and vomited. She assumed she was hung over; she’d been depressed lately and sometimes self-medicated with too much wine. But then a woman in her online counseling group suggested that she might be pregnant. Dass looked in the mirror and realized she was probably right."
Iowa,Q2,"Time, instead of adding to the luster of women’s sports as it does men’s, erodes it. The photograph of Muhammad Ali flexing over a fallen Sonny Liston is one of the most famous in sports history. The moment, and the image, are iconic, sold in every format imaginable, while also helping mythologize an athlete, a sport and even an era."
Iowa,Q2,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Iowa,Q2,"The current and potential 2024 presidential candidates showed strong support for gun owners’ rights — a core issue for the party’s base, but one that can be a tougher sell in a general election. They cited Scripture and issued calls for prayer. They applauded law enforcement and demanded tighter security in schools. They lamented the nation’s mental health crisis and offered tough talk about the death penalty."
Iowa,Q2,"Also, a guilty verdict for the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. George Floyd died more than three years ago at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, igniting nationwide protests against discriminatory policing and spurring a federal investigation into the city’s police force. Today, the Justice Department released its findings in a scathing 89-page report that found systemic abuses by the police in Minneapolis."
Iowa,Q2,"They rarely give on-the-record interviews. Only two are on Twitter. But they will be the main force behind the president’s political strategy. When President Biden announced his re-election campaign and its top two staff members this week, the names of his closest and longest-serving advisers were not included."
Iowa,Q2,"Those of us who thought he might willingly step down from the world’s highest perch were kidding ourselves. When I saw President George W. Bush aboard Air Force One during his first year in office, I finally fully got it — why an erstwhile cutup and goofball so strangely suited to the ordeal of a presidential campaign had put himself through one, losing sleep, tempting heartache, risking humiliation. On this airborne ego trip, he had a bed, and I don’t mean a seat that flattened into one. He had an office, with a desk bigger than those of some earthbound executives. Aides carried papers to him. Aides ferried papers away. They called him “Mr. President.” He’d upgraded from his old surname, as illustrious as it was, to a kind of divinity."
Iowa,Q2,"America can’t afford for voters worried about Biden’s age to be turned off by his running mate. A few weeks ago, one of France’s most famous public intellectuals, Bernard-Henri Lévy, gave an interview to The Times on his new documentary, “Slava Ukraini,” and he said something that helped me understand why, as I approach my 70th birthday, I still want to be a journalist."
Iowa,Q2,"The Manhattan indictments may not even present his biggest legal threat. Donald Trump is expected to turn himself in to the Manhattan authorities today. Further down, you can read about the latest developments and what to expect today."
Iowa,Q2,"The proposed debt cancellation of more than $400 billion would have been one of the most expensive executive actions in U.S. history. The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority with its plan to wipe out more than $400 billion in student debt, dashing the hopes of tens of millions of borrowers and imposing new restrictions on presidential power."
Iowa,Q2,"Somatic therapy is surging, with the promise that true healing may reside in focusing on the physical rather than the mental. After requesting my permission, Emily Price, the therapist on my laptop screen, spoke to my feet. She thanked them, saying that they probably had a lot to tell us."
Iowa,Q2,"He’s telling the unvarnished truth. How gratifying is that? Chris Christie made a complete fool of himself back in 2016, fan-dancing obsequiously around Donald Trump, angling for a crucial role in his administration, nattering on about their friendship, pretending or possibly even convincing himself that Trump could restrain his ego, check his nastiness, suspend his grift and, well, serve America. But then Christie, a former two-term governor of New Jersey, had plenty of company. And he never did style himself as some saint."
Iowa,Q2,"We only think we understand the impact of political spouses. From the breathless media coverage of Ron DeSantis’s recent visits to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, you could easily get the impression that:"
Iowa,Q2,The Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority with its plan to wipe out more than $400 billion in student debt.

The Supreme Court has ruled, 6-to-3, in favor of a Colorado website maker who does not want to make wedding websites celebrating same-sex marriages."
Iowa,Q3,"The 81-year-old Senate Republican leader, who had a serious fall earlier this year, was temporarily unable to speak during a news conference, raising questions about his health and future. Senator Mitch McConnell, the longtime Republican leader who had a serious head injury in a fall earlier this year, froze midsentence during an appearance at his weekly news conference in the Capitol on Wednesday and was briefly escorted away from the microphones to recover."
Iowa,Q3,"The Florida governor has recently highlighted his state’s response to the coronavirus in hopes of striking some distance from Donald Trump. Hank Miller, a 64-year-old Iowa farmer, started paying attention to Gov. Ron DeSantis during the coronavirus pandemic, when the Florida governor was a constant presence on Fox News highlighting the reopening of his state."
Iowa,Q3,"A new study ranked all 50 U.S. states across five categories to find which are most conducive to the retirement life. If you’re approaching retirement, there are important real estate decisions to make. Living on a fixed income often influences a move, but that’s not the only thing to consider."
Iowa,Q3,"A group of politically vulnerable G.O.P. women has backed legislation that purports to expand birth control access but would have little effect. Critics say the bill is meant to distract from their anti-abortion stances. She had barely opened her town hall to questions when Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican from a competitive district in Iowa, was pressed to defend her opposition to abortion rights."
Iowa,Q3,"Investigators found that major companies overseeing Medicaid patients’ health care frequently rejected doctors’ requests for approval of treatments and procedures. Private health insurance companies paid by Medicaid denied millions of requests for care for low-income Americans with little oversight from federal and state authorities, according to a new report by U.S. investigators published Wednesday."
Iowa,Q3,"Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott, fighting to become the leading Republican alternative to Donald Trump, have clashed in recent days over Florida’s educational standards. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida hit back on Friday at one of his leading Republican rivals, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, accusing the senator of credulously repeating liberal criticisms over Florida’s educational standards for the teaching of slavery."
Iowa,Q3,"The butter cow is a state fair institution. But the sculptors say there’s more than dairy to these pale yellow works of art. The oily visage of a butter cow is an alluring sight at state fairs across the nation, but few people have taken the time to think about what’s inside them. Warning: It’s not more butter."
Iowa,Q3,The group discusses the Republican primary field in advance of the first 2024 G.O.P. debate. The group discusses the Republican primary field in advance of the first 2024 G.O.P. debate.
Iowa,Q3,"Health experts warn that drinking it could come with risks. On July 1, Iowa officially became one of more than two dozen states that have legalized the sale of raw milk, or milk that has not been pasteurized."
Iowa,Q3,"Now that the U.S. government has stepped back from issuing vaccines, long-term care operators have yet to start administering shots to protect one of the most vulnerable populations. “Covid is not pretty in a nursing home,” said Deb Wityk, a 70-year-old retired massage therapist who lives in one called Spurgeon Manor, in rural Iowa. She has contracted the disease twice, and is eager to get the newly approved vaccine because she has chronic leukemia, which weakens her immune system."
Iowa,Q3,"Donald J. Trump loomed large over the campaign trail, even though he was among the few G.O.P. contenders who stayed away from it. At a high school cafeteria in Merrimack, N.H., on Tuesday, where patriotic music blasted from the speakers and the lunch tables were decked in star-spangled napery, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota mingled with families who were digging into eggs, sausage and pancakes at a Fourth of July breakfast hosted by the local Rotary Club."
Iowa,Q3,"The Democratic presidential challenger continues to espouse extreme ideas, but has dialed that messaging back in large public forums. In an online meeting with anti-vaccine activists on June 27, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat running for president, falsely said there was good evidence that vaccine research had caused millions of deaths during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. He also claimed that such research could have created Covid-19, H.I.V. and other deadly viruses."
Iowa,Q3,"The claustrophobic reality of Ron DeSantis and the other Republicans is that they constructed their identities as Trump alternatives and ended up all the same. There’s a late-summer-fade quality to the Republican primary contest, as if the candidates are passively sliding into the inevitability of a Biden-Trump rematch."
Iowa,Q3,"The longtime Democratic leader, who has served in the House for close to four decades, also left the door open to running again. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Senator Dianne Feinstein for remaining in office after a series of health issues, dismissing concerns about Ms. Feinstein’s continued ability to serve as a sexist double standard."
Iowa,Q3,"Apoorva Mandavilli, a health and science reporter for The New York Times, traveled across the country to learn how educators are preparing for the next pandemic. Since joining The New York Times as a global health and science reporter in May 2020, Apoorva Mandavilli has had one subject top of mind: the coronavirus pandemic."
Iowa,Q3,"The battle reflects the importance of social media for campaigns, and the growing threat of fake images and videos. The battle reflects the importance of social media for campaigns, and the growing threat of fake images and videos."
Iowa,Q3,"In her stump speech, the former governor calls for common sense and experience in the White House, leaving crowds wanting more. Nikki Haley is not as loud or fiery as some of her pulpit-pounding rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. But her pleas for common sense and experience in the White House often leave crowds wanting more."
Iowa,Q3,"Supporters of protecting abortion in the state’s Constitution submitted enough signatures to get on the November ballot. But another vote in August could make it harder to win. Ohio moved one step closer to becoming the next big test case in the nation’s fight over abortion, after supporters of a measure that would ask voters to establish a right to abortion in the state’s Constitution this week said they had filed more than enough signatures to put it on the ballot in November."
Iowa,Q3,"In an audio recording made just before the first G.O.P. debate, the super PAC’s chief strategist disparaged rivals and described an expensive attempt to thwart Donald Trump in Iowa. Hours before the Republican Party’s first presidential debate, the chief strategist for the super PAC that has effectively taken over Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign met with donors in Milwaukee."
Iowa,Q3,"In eight states, the estimated number of abortions increased by 60 percent or more as patients crossed state lines seeking care. In eight states, the estimated number of abortions increased by 60 percent or more as patients crossed state lines seeking care."
Iowa,Q3,"Congress has long been an institution that runs on seniority and rewards longevity, and these veteran lawmakers are still running the country at an age when most people are well into retirement. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the 81-year-old longtime Republican leader, has batted away questions about his health after twice freezing on camera, insisting he has no plans to step down ahead of schedule as the leader of his party in the Senate."
Iowa,Q3,"A growing number of spas and resorts are offering programs that target the changes of perimenopause and menopause. The biggest benefit may be the chance to bond with other women going through the same thing. With a growing number of women approaching the age of hormonal changes — by 2025, approximately 1.1 billion women worldwide will have experienced menopause — the travel industry is catering to a new niche: Women who want help dealing with everything from hot flashes to mood swings, with perhaps some classic spa treatments thrown in."
Iowa,Q3,"The death of an underage worker at a chicken plant in Hattiesburg, Miss., has put a spotlight on the rising number of child labor violations across the country. Federal authorities have opened an investigation into a Mississippi chicken plant after a 16-year-old boy died following a workplace accident there, officials said on Tuesday."
Iowa,Q3,"Ron DeSantis rose to prominence in part on his “anti-woke” agenda, especially when it comes to education. In some settings, culture-war messaging seems to be receding. Earlier this year, the Republican presidential primary looked as though it would be driven by conservative cultural battles, especially fights over education that had animated the party’s base since the pandemic."
Iowa,Q3,"The former vice president has made misleading claims about abortion, fiscal policy and military spending. Since beginning his long-shot presidential campaign in June, former Vice President Mike Pence has struggled to gain traction among Republican primary voters."
Iowa,Q3,"What happens when an editor who runs a breaking news team for The Times turns off his phone and takes a weeklong vow of silence at a meditation retreat? It was a little after 5:30 a.m., a cold dawn in June, and I was sitting on a meditation cushion in a big red barn in the Hudson Valley. A dozen other people sat with me in deep silence. Hundreds of birds began to sing in the meadows and trees. In the distance, we could hear livestock and machinery, the sounds of a working farm waking up."
Iowa,Q3,"A symbol of dirty habits and corporate greed — and an enduring icon of old-school glamour — smoking is making an unlikely comeback in sculpture, design and even food. This past spring, Andrew Gori, 40, and Ambre Kelly, 44, the founders of the Spring/Break Art Show — a fair for emerging and midcareer artists — decided to pull together a last-minute, salon-style pop-up in New York’s NoLIta based on what their “alums had available in their studios right at that moment,” Gori says. As the submissions rolled in, one trend stood out: “There were so many cigarettes!” So many, in fact, that when their “Secret Show” opened in May, one room was dedicated entirely to cigarette-inspired art: There were nearly three-foot-high versions that resembled shaggy plush toys, made by Thomas Martinez-Pilnik, 29. There were sculptures in a variety of stubbed-out shapes constructed from steel by Mary Gagler, and clay by Emily Marchand. And on a 4-by-5-foot square of AstroTurf, 17 true-to-scale ceramic butts by Taylor Lee Nicholson, 32, were scattered like the contents of an overturned ashtray. “For these artists, cigarettes seem to represent childhood memories of their parents or grandparents smoking, but also a lost human connection,” Gori says. “I think there’s a yearning to return to an analog socialness and a time that cigarettes represent.”"
Iowa,Q3,"The party’s big donors have made clear their distaste for the former president. Now, as he barrels toward the nomination, they are reacting with a mix of hand-wringing, calls to arms and fatalism. On Labor Day, Eric Levine, a New York lawyer and Republican fund-raiser, sent an email to roughly 1,500 donors, politicians and friends."

Iowa,Q3,"Once a vaccine advocate, the Florida governor lost his enthusiasm for the shot before the Delta wave sent Covid hospitalizations and deaths soaring. It’s a grim chapter he now leaves out of his rosy retelling of his pandemic response. On a Saturday in September 2020, with Covid-19 killing more than 600 Americans daily and hundreds of thousands of deaths still to come, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, heard her cellphone ring. It was Dr. Scott Rivkees, the Florida surgeon general. He was distraught."
Iowa,Q3,"The truth, established by his record as president, is that he is as committed to outlawing abortion in the United States as any other conservative Republican. As a candidate for president in 2016, Donald Trump promised to put “pro-life justices” on the Supreme Court. He even issued a list of potential nominees that featured some of the most conservative judges in the country."
Iowa,Q3,"A super PAC backing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s bid for the Democratic nomination received $5 million from a major Republican donor who has supported Donald J. Trump in the past. As he cut into steak frites at the recent fund-raiser he hosted for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, the financier Omeed Malik surveyed the crowd."
Iowa,Q3,"Indictments and debate drama ensure that the primary revolves around him. There was a time, not all that long ago, when being indicted was bad for a politician’s career. That time is over — at least for Donald Trump."
Iowa,Q3,"It can’t be cured; it can be treated. Stephanie Cacioppo thought she would be single forever. “I was an only child,” says Dr. Cacioppo. “I always thought that was my fate to be alone.”"
Iowa,Q3,"Articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."
Iowa,Q3,"These glossy cookies come from ancient Korea, but their ginger-honey flavors are timeless. Once, when the chef Junghyun Park was young, his cousin brought a piece of fresh honeycomb over to his house in Seoul."
Iowa,Q3,"Why a general-election sales pitch might not hurt the front-runner in the primaries. As Ron DeSantis’s challenge to Donald Trump has seemed to wither on the vine, a piece of conventional wisdom has hardened: That DeSantis has been offering Republican voters Trumpism without the drama, but now we know Republicans love the drama, indeed they can’t live without the drama, and mere substance simply leaves them cold."
Iowa,Q3,A battle over Puerto Rico statehood and claims of a “takeover” are testing a 94-year-old civil rights organization known as LULAC. One of the nation’s oldest and most venerated Latino civil rights organizations is at a critical juncture that some members say could determine its direction — or have dire implications for its future.
Iowa,Q3,"Big Lawn is no less formidable a foe than Big Oil or Big Tobacco, which is why an audacious gesture is needed on the most prominent lawn of all. I recently committed an act of sabotage at one of the most revered landmarks in the United States, a transgression against my relatively new hometown, Washington. Walking across the National Mall, I tore open a packet of wildflower seeds — sky lupine, mountain phlox, coreopsis — and scattered its contents across the grass."
Iowa,Q3,"This weekend, make eggplant Parmesan. Employers across the U.S. added 187,000 jobs in July, and the unemployment rate sank to a near record low of 3.5 percent, new data showed today. Most people who want to work can find jobs, according to the report."
Iowa,Q3,"Also, the attorney general was grilled by House Republicans. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. Federal Reserve officials left interest rates unchanged today, a reflection of cooling inflation and a decision designed to give them more time to assess their next step. At the same time, they hinted that another rate hike would arrive later this year and projected that interest rates would remain high for longer than they had previously expected."

Iowa,Q3,"In Berlin, some marathon runners came for the party. The marathon runners were wearing neon and sipping beers."
Iowa,Q3,"Is the retailer a monopoly? It depends on how you define its competition. Americans buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. But Americans also just buy a lot of stuff. This presents a problem for anyone contending that Amazon acts as a monopoly: The company is huge, but depending on how you measure its place in the vastness of American retail, its presence isn’t necessarily overwhelming, let alone clearly illegally monopolistic."
Iowa,Q3,"The Swiss bank’s sharply discounted takeover of Credit Suisse led to a paper gain that gave it the biggest quarterly profit by a bank in history. When UBS agreed to buy its archrival, Credit Suisse, for a little over $3 billion this spring at the Swiss government’s behest, analysts and investors said that price represented a steep discount. UBS’s latest financial results reflect just how much of a steal it was."
Iowa,Q4,"The increases were particularly stark among babies born to Native American, Alaska Native and white mothers in 2022. Rates among Black infants remained highest of all. The number of American babies who died before their first birthdays rose last year, significantly increasing the nation’s infant mortality rate for the first time in two decades, according to provisional figures released Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics."
Iowa,Q4,"The Florida governor entered the year flush with cash and momentum. In the months since, internal chaos and Donald Trump’s indictments have sapped even his most avid supporters. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida woke up in Iowa with a familiar political headache."
Iowa,Q4,"The JPMorgan Chase C.E.O.’s show of support for Ms. Haley came on the same day that a new super PAC set out to try to draw independent voters to her candidacy. The chief executive of Wall Street’s largest bank threw his support behind Nikki Haley on Wednesday, just as a group of entrepreneurs confirmed that they were forming a super PAC to try to draw independent voters to her."
Iowa,Q4,"The Florida governor’s campaign, facing a cash crunch, has found a way to offload the steep costs of private air travel. Campaign finance experts say the arrangement could test the limits of the law. Short on cash, Gov. Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign has found an unusual way to pay for his habit of flying in private planes: passing the cost to the better-funded super PAC that is increasingly intertwined with his operation."
Iowa,Q4,"Rhetorical training is tantamount to installing the operating system for adult social life. At the risk of sounding mawkishly positive, I think I’ve discovered a cheap, simple fix for our fraying social, emotional and political health."
Iowa,Q4,"The help Americans receive after disasters isn’t just inadequate; it’s complicated to navigate and painfully slow to arrive. This summer, 12 people let me into their lives to tell me about their experiences in the aftermath of disasters, including hurricanes, floods, freezes, wildfires and derechos. All said, they did not receive the aid they expected, and the effects have been devastating. “It’s been a very humbling experience, to say the least, to go from ‘We’re fine, we just got a new house, we have a huge savings, biggest we’ve ever had’ to ‘You have nothing and you lost everything and you have to go to food pantries for food,’” said Aleasha LeClere, whose life was turned upside down by a 2020 derecho in Iowa. According to research on disasters and advocacy groups, these survivors’ experiences are very much the norm."
Iowa,Q4,"Win or lose, Nikki Haley knows how to run. A long time ago in South Carolina, as Nikki Haley recalls when she talks to voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, she ran campaigns that nobody thought much of until, unexpectedly, suddenly, she was winning them. Is that what’s happening here? Is this real?"
Iowa,Q4,"Longevity drugs for our canine companions are moving closer to reality. They also raise questions about what it might mean to succeed. The life of a pet dog follows a predictable trajectory. Over time, the floppy-eared puppy that keeps falling asleep in his food bowl will become a lanky-legged adolescent with an insatiable interest in squirrels — before eventually settling into adulthood as a canine creature of habit, with a carefully chosen napping location and a well-rehearsed greeting ritual."
Iowa,Q4,"The G.O.P. field, including former President Trump, has been wading into the emotional debate among students playing out over the deadly war between Hamas and Israel. As tensions mount on U.S. college campuses over the war in Gaza, several Republican presidential candidates are proposing a crackdown on students and schools that express opposition to Israel, appear to express support for the deadly Hamas attacks or fail to address antisemitism."
Iowa,Q4,"The debate over aid in dying still rages in the language that medicine and the media use to describe the practice. In rural Iowa, Peg Sandeen recalls, living with AIDS meant living under the cloud of your neighbors’ judgment. After her husband, John, fell ill in 1992, the rumors began swirling. The couple had almost learned to live with the stigma when things took a turn for the worse."
Iowa,Q4,"The president’s push to focus attention on the domestic economy comes as his administration has been dealing with events overseas after the terrorist attacks in Israel. President Biden on Wednesday began a tour of rural communities at a Minnesota hog farm where he lamented the loss of family farms, attacked the corporate consolidation of agriculture and pledged to oversee a renaissance of the American heartland."

Iowa,Q4,"Powerful players in the business world have gravitated toward Nikki Haley, aware that she remains an underdog but beginning to believe she has a chance. Late last month, Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, got an unexpected call from Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Dimon said he was impressed by Ms. Haley’s knowledge of policy details and her open-minded approach to complex issues raised in the Republican presidential race, according to a person familiar with what they discussed. Keep it up, he told her."
Iowa,Q4,Culture battles on gender and race did not seem to move many voters. Conservative activists for parental rights in education were dealt several high-profile losses in state and school board elections on Tuesday.
Iowa,Q4,"Can a Democrat win the Deep South? And other questions to help you make sense of the results. Today is Election Day, and we are using this newsletter to give you a guide. One theme is that Democrats are hoping to continue their strong recent electoral performance despite President Biden’s low approval rating."
Iowa,Q4,"As President Biden grapples with an unwieldy crisis at the southern border, his likely 2024 rival has leveled many criticisms — including some baseless and misleading claims. Former President Donald J. Trump has drawn widespread censure after reprising a line that casts undocumented immigrants as “poisoning the blood of our country.”"
Iowa,Q4,"Some patients are speaking up about lasting sexual problems after stopping antidepressants, a poorly understood condition. Doctors and patients have long known that antidepressants can cause sexual problems. No libido. Pleasureless orgasms. Numb genitals. Well over half of people taking the drugs report such side effects."
Iowa,Q4,"Also, Biden plans to skip the U.N. climate summit. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. Israel and Hamas agreed today to extend by two days a cease-fire that has brought a measure of calm to the Gaza Strip after seven weeks of intense warfare, according to officials in Qatar who were involved in the negotiations. The two sides struck a deal to exchange more hostages and prisoners and allow more aid into Gaza."
Iowa,Q4,"There wasn’t much to love about 2023, either. Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. This is our last conversation for the year, so let me first wish you and Dan a Merry Christmas."
Iowa,Q4,"As they vie to be the race’s Trump alternative, the two Republican rivals have been trading barbs, zeroing in on each other’s response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Once distant rivals in the 2024 presidential race, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are now locked in a heated battle to become the most viable Republican alternative to former President Donald J. Trump, seizing on the Israel-Hamas conflict to hurl broadsides at each other."

Iowa,Q4,"Several anti-Trump Republican donors and strategists are pushing Mr. Christie to end his presidential campaign and back Nikki Haley. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, has traveled the world in his quest to stop Donald J. Trump’s march to the Republican nomination. In New Hampshire living rooms as well as the charred homes of Israeli families killed by Hamas, he has assailed the former president as being unfit to lead, antidemocratic and an aspiring dictator."
Iowa,Q4,"Former President Donald J. Trump has repeatedly accused the Biden administration of criminalizing Christians, and Catholics in particular, for their faith. Here are the facts.

Iowa,Q4,"A new drug could help extend the lives of dogs. Would you give it to your pet? Do you have pets, or have you ever had one? Would you like to have one?"
Iowa,Q4,"The former president said that threats from abroad were less concerning than liberal “threats from within” and that he was a “very proud election denier.” Former President Donald J. Trump, on a day set aside to celebrate those who have defended the United States in uniform, promised to honor veterans in part by assailing what he portrayed as America’s greatest foe: the political left."
Iowa,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Iowa,Q4,"Ron DeSantis has spent heavily and Nikki Haley has padded her war chest. On the Democratic side, President Biden continues to show overall strength, and the party’s incumbent senators fared well. Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign entered October with nearly as much cash on hand for the Republican primary race as the rest of the field combined, underscoring the former president’s dominance as the contest enters its critical final stretch before the Iowa caucuses in January."
Iowa,Q4,A look at last night’s election results. Yesterday’s elections went well for the Democratic Party.
Iowa,Q4,"Wednesday’s Trump-less debate is a breakthrough moment for a fledgling cable network — and a comeback of sorts for Ms. Kelly, a former Fox News star. Eight years ago, Megyn Kelly’s turn as a debate moderator made headlines around the world. Before an audience of 24 million Fox News viewers, she confronted Donald J. Trump about his history of misogynist remarks, setting off a well-publicized feud that helped her leap from cable news to NBC."
Iowa,Q4,"Tough promises on immigration from Nikki Haley and her rivals for the Republican nomination face logistical and legal barriers. On the national debate stage, in interviews and at town halls, the message on immigration from every top Republican in the 2024 presidential race has resounded clearly: It is time to shut down the nation’s southern border."
Iowa,Q4,"Mr. Sununu is popular in the state, though former President Donald J. Trump continues to dominate the field. Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire endorsed Nikki Haley for the Republican presidential nomination at a campaign event Tuesday evening, casting her as a fresh face for the party who could take on the elites in Washington and move the nation past the “nonsense and drama” of former President Donald J. Trump."
Iowa,Q4,"The father of Jeffrey Dahmer, he wrote a memoir that one reviewer said sought to “peer not just into the soul of his son but into his own.” Lionel Dahmer, the father of the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and the author of a haunting memoir about his son’s youth, died on Dec. 5 in Medina, Ohio. He was 87."
Iowa,Q4,"The decision by Senator Joe Manchin III will leave open a seat in a deeply red state, threatening Democrats’ hold on the Senate. Senator Joe Manchin III, the conservative West Virginia Democrat known for bipartisan deal-making and also for frustrating some of his party’s most ambitious policy goals, announced on Thursday that he would not seek re-election, dealing a blow to Democrats’ chances of holding the Senate next year."
Iowa,Q4,We highlight some of the best work from news outlets across the U.S. Many of this country’s biggest problems are devilishly hard to solve. The decline of local news may be different.
Iowa,Q4,"Former President Jimmy Carter emerged from hospice care to join a cast of political heavyweights paying tribute to Mrs. Carter, who died at 96 last week at her home in Plains, Ga. Her journey took her from the smallest of small towns in rural Georgia to the majesty of the White House, from the campaign trails of Iowa and New Hampshire to refugee camps in Asia and impoverished villages in Africa."
Iowa,Q4,"After their party was decimated in the 2008 elections, mainstream Republican leaders believed they could harness rising far-right populist forces. Instead, they were overrun by them. The roots of the Republican crackup this fall that paralyzed the House, fueled the unexpected rise of Speaker Mike Johnson and now threatens to force a government shutdown crisis early next year lie in a fateful choice the party made more than a decade ago that has come back to haunt its leaders."
Iowa,Q4,"Donald Trump has long exhibited authoritarian impulses, but his policy operation is now more sophisticated, and the buffers to check him are weaker. In the spring of 1989, the Chinese Communist Party used tanks and troops to crush a pro-democracy protest in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Most of the West, across traditional partisan lines, was aghast at the crackdown that killed at least hundreds of student activists. But one prominent American was impressed."
Iowa,Q4,"The Times’s century-old charity fund has a new name. Last year, Tyhran Khosrovian and Olena Holeha survived the siege of Mariupol. They fled Ukraine, as millions have since the war began, and became refugees in the United States. After arriving in Brooklyn, they slept on a leaky air mattress in an apartment they shared with Khosrovian’s family."

Iowa,Q4,"The pay increases are the largest that autoworkers have received in decades. If you want to understand why the United Auto Workers union has evidently won its strikes against Detroit’s Big Three, it helps to return to the work of a 20th-century economist named Richard Lester."
Iowa,Q4,"If he regains power, Donald Trump wants not only to revive some of the immigration policies criticized as draconian during his presidency, but expand and toughen them. Former President Donald J. Trump is planning an extreme expansion of his first-term crackdown on immigration if he returns to power in 2025 — including preparing to round up undocumented people already in the United States on a vast scale and detain them in sprawling camps while they wait to be expelled."
Iowa,Q4,"Donald J. Trump and his allies are already laying the groundwork for a possible second Trump presidency, forging plans for an even more extreme agenda than his first term. Since beginning his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump has said the “termination” of the Constitution would have been justified to overturn the 2020 election, told followers “I am your retribution” and vowed to use the Justice Department to prosecute his adversaries — starting with President Biden and his family."
Iowa,Q4,Policies restricting phone use in schools are trending. We asked students if they thought such rules were a good idea. Nearly one in four countries has laws or policies banning or restricting student cellphone use in schools. Proponents say no-phone rules reduce student distractions and bullying. Critics say the bans could hinder student self-direction and critical thinking.
Iowa,Q4,"What primed some evangelical Christians to think in apocalyptic terms about America? Jane Coaston interviews Tim Alberta about Donald Trump, Covid and Christianity. Roughly 24 percent of Americans consider themselves born again or evangelical, but what that means — spiritually, culturally, politically — depends on whom you ask. For some evangelicals, the role of politics, particularly the politics of today’s Republican Party, has taken on deep importance, changing how they relate to their faith, their faith leadership and one another."
Iowa,Q4,"From wildfires to wars, labor strikes to political protests, 2023 was a big year. All year long, we photographed the people whose lives were shaped by the news. From wildfires to wars, labor strikes to political protests, 2023 was a big year. All year long, we photographed the people whose lives were shaped by the news."
Iowa,Q4,"The British entertainer built an army of fans with his conspiracy-minded podcast. Now, amid sex-assault claims against him, they’ve become his whole world. On Sept. 12, four days before he was expected at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theater for another sold-out show, Russell Brand asked his fans for a favor. “I’ve always struggled with authority and being told what to do,” he wrote to ticketholders, attaching a questionnaire for a planned bit with his audience. “Even when it comes to something small like being offered a seat by a doctor, I’ll purposefully refuse rather than comply. Tell me about your relationship with authority — whether you tend to yield to authority or fight it.”"
Iowa,Q4,He left politics for a talk show and paved the way for reality television. He left politics for a talk show and paved the way for reality television.

Kansas,Q1,"The state is taking action against three major drug companies and the big pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to temper costs for people with diabetes. Many Americans with diabetes still struggle to pay for their insulin, even though Medicare placed a cap on co-payments this month."
Kansas,Q1,"The passing game is only part of Cincinnati’s offensive might, Travis Kelce proved to be the ultimate safety valve for Patrick Mahomes and the Giants face difficult decisions after their loss. In the N.F.L.’s divisional-round games, the Bengals got a statement win on the road against the Bills’ fearsome defense, Patrick Mahomes added to his legend by depending on his favored target, and the Eagles’ rout of the Giants provided a measure of clarity for the losing team."
Kansas,Q1,"The A.A.P. is recommending early and intensive interventions. Can that happen without furthering stigma? The American Academy of Pediatrics released new guidance last week about how to evaluate and treat children who are overweight or obese, issuing a 73-page document that argues obesity should no longer be stigmatized as simply the result of personal choices, but understood as a complex disease with short- and long-term health implications."
Kansas,Q1,"The Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin collapsed in cardiac arrest on the Bengals’ field last week. He is doing better and, with a win over the Ravens, so are the Bengals. CINCINNATI — The tribute outside the University of Cincinnati Medical Center started small. On Tuesday, the day after Buffalo Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and collapsed after a routine tackle in a nationally televised game against the Cincinnati Bengals, it included only a few signs and some lit candles."
Kansas,Q1,"Shares in the bank, a go-to funder of tech start-ups, have fallen more than 60 percent in the past day as investors fear for its finances, and those of similarly sized lenders. Shares in U.S. banks appear poised to slide again on Friday, after the sector suffered a $52 billion sell-off on Thursday, its worst drop in three years. Driving investor concerns is the health of Silicon Valley Bank, one of the biggest lenders to tech start-ups, which is urgently raising cash to shore up its finances."
Kansas,Q1,"I’m afraid pregnant women will die if we don’t change Tennessee’s abortion law. Before the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, I did not consider myself an abortion provider. Ninety-five percent of my work as a high-risk obstetrician was helping women through complex pregnancies to achieve healthy outcomes for both them and their babies."
Kansas,Q1,"The N.F.L. has a number of options, none of them perfect, for how to handle competition for the last week of the regular season and the playoffs. The N.F.L. announced on Thursday that it had canceled the remainder of Monday’s game between the Bengals and the Bills."
Kansas,Q1,We examine the raging debate about smartphones and teenage mental health. Digital technology has caused the biggest changes to teenage life in many decades. Typical American teenagers spend about half of their waking hours on their smartphones. They are on the phones when they are alone at home and when they are hanging out with friends.
Kansas,Q1,"The decision overturns the state’s six-week ban on abortion, a major victory for abortion rights in the South, where the procedure is strictly limited. The South Carolina Constitution provides a right to privacy that includes the right to abortion, the state’s Supreme Court ruled on Thursday, saying “the decision to terminate a pregnancy rests upon the utmost personal and private considerations imaginable.”"
Kansas,Q1,"Despite having left town in 1954, the Athletics, with five championships, are still Philadelphia’s most decorated team. The Eagles could tie things up on Sunday. Follow our live updates of the Super Bowl between Philadelphia and Kansas City."
Kansas,Q1,"No. 15 Princeton toppled Arizona, a No. 2 seed that was one of the favorites in the field, while No. 13 seed Furman knocked down No. 4 Virginia. SACRAMENTO — Nearly three decades after one of the most stunning upsets in N.C.A.A. history, the Princeton Tigers delivered another with a shocking 59-55 victory over second-seeded Arizona on Thursday."
Kansas,Q1,"Some people who have long lived with the disease say they worry about living as a healthy person, while others are concerned about the obstacles to getting treatment. Terry Jackson lives a life dominated by sickle cell disease. The genetic disorder, in which misshapen red cells become wedged in blood vessels, causes him daily bone pain and lower back pain and has sent him to the hospital for pain treatment and life threatening emergencies for five decades. He has frequent transfusions of fresh blood."
Kansas,Q1,"Four states could ban transition care into young adulthood. Lawmakers in several others want to restrict drag shows in ways that could affect transgender performers broadly. It’s part of a long-term plan. Over the past three years, Republican state lawmakers have put forward a barrage of bills to regulate the lives of transgender youths, restricting the sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and medical care they can receive."
Kansas,Q1,"The chain’s situation shows the complicated legal and reputational landscape that it and its competitors must navigate in the post-Roe era. Walgreens landed at the center of a consumer and political firestorm in recent days, after saying it would not dispense an abortion pill in 21 states where Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action against pharmacies that try to distribute the medication."
Kansas,Q1,"They said watching the Bills lose four straight Super Bowls taught them about football and life. The Times asked which of those lessons of fandom were worth passing on to their children now that the team is favored to win it all. Stephen Soroka was 10 years old in January 1991 when the Buffalo Bills made their first Super Bowl appearance. He lived in East Aurora, N.Y., about a 20-minute drive from Buffalo. Everyone he knew was caught up in the excitement of what seemed like a certain championship."
Kansas,Q1,"G.O.P. elites are simply lagging their states. My whole adult life, the work of fighting climate change was understood as the job of the blue team in America. The red team, we knew, just wasn’t going to play ball."
Kansas,Q1,"A wave of teenagers who developed tics during the pandemic has receded, illustrating the powerful influence of stress on the body and the resilience of adolescents. CALGARY, Alberta — Aidan’s tics erupted one day after school in early 2021, about a month after the long pandemic lockdown had ended. The 16-year-old convulsed while walking into the house, head snapping and arms swinging, sometimes letting out high-pitched whistles and whoops."
Kansas,Q1,"According to one recent analysis, over half of teachers surveyed are considering quitting. Here are five that already have. Driving home one day in the fall of 2021 from her job as an art teacher at a low-income public charter school near Sacramento, Calif., Ruth Santer fell asleep at the wheel. She often came home physically spent after a day of arriving early, wielding heavy art supplies and staying late to prepare art materials, all while managing a full classroom of middle school students. The work had always been strenuous but pandemic stresses had added to her level of exhaustion."
Kansas,Q1,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Kansas,Q1,"The broadcast on Saturday was a test of how the networks are going to cover the sport in the wake of Damar Hamlin’s collapse on the field last Monday. Shortly after a brief pregame tribute to Damar Hamlin, the Buffalo Bills player who collapsed and went into cardiac arrest on “Monday Night Football,” and a live broadcast of the national anthem, ESPN’s play-by-play announcer spoke up."
Kansas,Q1,"“Granny flats” are popping up in backyards across the country, affording Americans a new housing option. Some communities are not happy about it. Forty-five years ago, Betty Szudy and her wife, Maggie Roth, both 70, bought a Craftsman bungalow in Oakland, Calif. In 2017, at the same time their son and his wife were fruitlessly searching for an affordable apartment in the neighborhood, California was liberalizing its housing laws to encourage so-called accessory dwelling units, or A.D.U.s."
Kansas,Q1,"The profession was considered unladylike in 1890s England, where she was refused admission to dental school. But she found one in Scotland, and became a notable figure in dentistry. When the headmistress at the North London Collegiate School told Lilian Lindsay that she should become a teacher, and that she would block her from finding any other type of work, Lindsay shot back: “You cannot prevent me from being a dentist.”"

Kansas,Q1,"Once the worst of the pandemic passed, some of us turned from being savers to spenders — setting ourselves up for potential disaster. In the first couple of months this year, thousands of American workers at companies like Google and Twitter have lost their jobs. Interest rates on car loans, credit cards and mortgages are higher than ever, and inflation keeps rising. And the talk of a recession in 2023 hasn’t gone away."
Kansas,Q1,"The issue is no longer a political hammer for the right. In decades past, as the calendar turned to January, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade would come into view. Abortion opponents would be planning to acknowledge the date with the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. Supporters of abortion rights would schedule seminars or meet for quiet conversations about whether and when the Supreme Court might actually go so far as to repudiate the decision it issued 50 years ago on Jan. 22, 1973."
Kansas,Q1,"The Israeli prime minister has yet to uphold a decision by the Supreme Court that a key government minister convicted of tax fraud should be dismissed. The new right-wing Israeli government and the country’s judiciary were locked in a standoff Thursday, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed upholding a Supreme Court ruling that called for the dismissal of a key government minister."
Kansas,Q1,"A preview for fans and non-fans alike. For many Americans, the next few days are among the most entertaining of the year. They will be filled with dozens of college basketball games, featuring major surprises and thrilling finishes. When a team loses, its season is over."
Kansas,Q1,"Hamlin, a 24-year-old safety, went into cardiac arrest after being hit, but his heartbeat was restored by medical personnel, the Bills said. The game against the Cincinnati Bengals was postponed. CINCINNATI — Damar Hamlin, a 24-year-old safety in his second season with the Buffalo Bills, was in critical condition in a hospital after going into cardiac arrest during a Monday night game against the Cincinnati Bengals, the Bills said."
Kansas,Q1,"The country-music star is trying to revive her childhood home in Oklahoma with a restaurant, concert stage and lots of Reba memorabilia. ATOKA, Okla. — Year after year, eight million vehicles drove through this sleepy town just off U.S. Highway 75, which stretches from Texas to Canada. Almost none of them stopped."
Kansas,Q1,The war in Ukraine is entering a new phase. We explain each side’s strategy. The war in Ukraine appears to be on the cusp of a new phase.
Kansas,Q1,"Aryeh Deri, who has a conviction for tax fraud, was deemed unfit to serve in the government, leaving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a legal and political predicament. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Sunday dismissed a senior minister recently convicted of tax fraud to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that disqualified the minister from serving, shaking the right-wing government just weeks after it came to power."
Kansas,Q1,"Bola Tinubu, declared the winner on Wednesday in the presidential election, has boasted of making the careers of major politicians. Now he has to deliver for a divided country facing multiple emergencies. In the run-up to Nigeria’s presidential election on Saturday, the ruling party candidate’s best-known slogan was “Emi lo kan,” a phrase in the Yoruba language meaning “It’s my turn.”"
Kansas,Q1,"Anti-trans legislation in dozens of states is an attack on parental rights. JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Russel Neiss glanced down at his Apple Watch. The screen glowed bright red, warning of something he already knew: Though he was sitting stock still, waiting to testify before state senators, his heart was hammering."
Kansas,Q1,"Republican legislators in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Alaska are pushing back against it much more forcefully than Kevin McCarthy. While 20 hard-right members of the U.S. House of Representatives held the national Republican leadership hostage in Washington last week — forcing concession after concession — something very different was taking place in the Republican-controlled South Carolina House of Representatives."

Kansas,Q1,"Justices will hear arguments Tuesday on President Biden’s plan to forgive an estimated $400 billion in debt. Conservative states have called it an abuse of his authority. In September, Jason Doresky received a $10,000 direct deposit from the Education Department. It was a refund for payments he had made voluntarily on his federal student loans since March 2020, when the government told borrowers that they could stop paying temporarily because of the pandemic."
Kansas,Q1,"Bison once numbered in the tens of millions in the United States. Now, a nonprofit is working to restore the shortgrass prairie, where the American icons and their ecosystem can thrive again. MALTA, Mont. — Around 200 chocolate-brown bison raise their heads, following the low growl of a pickup truck slowly motoring across the sagebrush-studded prairie."
Kansas,Q1,"The relationships between big cities and rural-dominated legislatures have often been hostile. But a rift between Nashville and the Tennessee Legislature suggests the nation’s partisan divide is making things worse. WASHINGTON — Rural legislators have looked down on big cities, and urban pols have returned the favor, since the farmer-statesman Thomas Jefferson called urban areas “pestilential to the morals, the health and the liberties of man.” But for most of American history, the rivalry has played out in state politics more so as a matter of parochial divisions than national ones."
Kansas,Q1,"An uncle of Damar Hamlin, a Bills safety who went into cardiac arrest during Monday’s game, said Tuesday night that doctors were working to get his nephew breathing on his own without a ventilator. Buffalo Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin remained in critical condition on Tuesday after he went into cardiac arrest during a prime-time N.F.L. game, a frightening reminder of the ever-present risk of serious injury in America’s biggest sport that has the league facing one of its worst crises in decades."
Kansas,Q1,"Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind. The 2023 tax filing season is probably most notable for what’s missing: After three years of stimulus payments and pandemic tax breaks, nearly all of those extra benefits have faded away — and tax refunds are likely to shrink as a result."
Kansas,Q1,"Elizabeth Koch, the daughter of the right-wing political force Charles Koch, is working to bridge societal divides. Sure, roll your eyes. But also, why not her? Even as a young girl, Elizabeth R. Koch was keenly aware of her family’s extreme wealth."
Kansas,Q1,"The question is at the heart of the human experience — and the nation’s abortion debate. An exploration through science, theology and philosophy.

Kansas,Q1,It’s a day of uncertainty for the U.S. economy. Today is a day of uncertainty for the American economy.
Kansas,Q1,"A cult comedy, the series returns 13 years after it last aired. There’s still time to catch up. When I was 15, I worked for a caterer, answering phones and making vinaigrette by the gallon. I wanted nothing so desperately as to join the ranks of the cater-waiters, the older kids whose driver’s licenses allowed them to pilot a van full of chafing dishes to glamorous fetes at large, forbidding houses where they would sneak wine and look through medicine cabinets."
Kansas,Q1,"The administration faced a conservative court that has insisted that government initiatives with major political and economic consequences be clearly authorized by Congress. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed deeply skeptical on Tuesday of the legality of the Biden administration’s plan to wipe out more than $400 billion in student debt, heightening the prospect that the justices would thwart efforts to forgive the loans of tens of millions of borrowers."
Kansas,Q1,"Even as the sprawling dining halls of old struggle with emptier workplaces, food is still important to employees, particularly the young. Many companies are reinventing the company meal. The corporate cafeteria can be an especially lonely place these days."
Kansas,Q1,"Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky is popular. Is that enough to win in a state where Democrats have struggled? The first concrete sign that this year’s race for governor of Kentucky would be a hot one came in August, when Beth Drennan’s latest grand champion, a 17-pound uncooked country ham, sold at a charity auction for the cool price of $5 million."

Kansas,Q2,"Despite the surgeon general’s warning about its risks for youth in general, researchers and teenagers say it can be a “lifeline” for L.G.B.T.Q. youth. The surgeon general’s warning Tuesday about social media’s “profound risk of harm” to young people included a significant qualification. For some of them, the warning said, social media can be beneficial to health in important ways."
Kansas,Q2,Social acceptance among young people has increased significantly in only a decade. But the mental health of L.G.B.T.Q. teens is suffering. Social acceptance among young people has increased significantly in only a decade. But the mental health of L.G.B.T.Q. teens is suffering.
Kansas,Q2,"In his emergency regulation, the state attorney general said it was necessary to put up “substantial guardrails” around gender-transitioning treatments, because they were considered “experimental.” The Missouri attorney general, citing a consumer protection law normally used to prosecute fraudulent business practices, issued a new state directive this week that would severely restrict gender-transitioning treatment for both adults and minors."
Kansas,Q2,"She first became known for novels set in the distant past. She later wrote contemporary tales that involved computer hacking and Ponzi schemes. Julie Garwood, a romance novelist whose books — some set centuries ago, some sampling present-day maladies like computer hacking and Ponzi schemes — routinely landed on best-seller lists, died on June 8 at her home in Leawood, Kan., on the Missouri border. She was 78."

Kansas,Q2,"Democrats brought to the floor a set of bills intended to protect women’s health and reproductive freedom, knowing they would be blocked by Republicans. Senate Democrats on Wednesday forced consideration of measures intended to protect women’s health and reproductive freedom, using the upcoming anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade to remind voters of Republican opposition to measures with broad voter approval."
Kansas,Q2,"Advocates could run into major roadblocks when it comes to collecting signatures for the measure, which Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Republicans are sure to oppose. A coalition of organizations that support abortion rights is planning to spend millions of dollars in an effort to place a measure protecting abortion rights on Florida’s ballot next year."
Kansas,Q2,"If we are willing to help people end their physical suffering by assisting their death, can we in good conscience deny them that help for their mental suffering? My first attempt to kill myself was when I was a child. I tried again as a teenager; as an adult, I’ve attempted suicide repeatedly and in a variety of ways. And yet, as a 55-year-old white man (a member of one of the groups at the highest risk for suicide in America) and the happily married father of five children, I am thankful that I am incompetent at killing myself."
Kansas,Q2,"A record-breaking heat wave is expected to worsen through the weekend as it spreads through nearby states. A weather pattern that has brought unrelenting heat to Texas for more than a week is unlikely to end until at least early July, according to forecast models, with record-breaking heat expected to expand into nearby states this weekend."

Kansas,Q2,"The legislation, which includes an exemption for people already receiving treatment, now goes to the desk of the Republican governor. In the waning days of their legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday that would ban transition care for transgender youth."
Kansas,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors. Ten states in the past three months have passed laws prohibiting what is known as gender-affirming care for young people, in a rapid effort by Republican lawmakers across the country."
Kansas,Q2,"Apple, Starbucks, Trader Joe’s and REI are accused of targeting union supporters after organizing efforts gained traction, charges the companies deny. After working for more than seven years at an Apple store in Kansas City, Mo., Gemma Wyatt ran into trouble."

For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted.
Kansas,Q2,"More than 20 Republican-led states have passed bills regulating the lives of transgender children and adolescents since the start of 2021. State laws restricting transition care for minors have surged over the past few months, as part of a Republican movement to regulate the lives of transgender youth."
Kansas,Q2,"In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities. In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities."
Kansas,Q2,"It will take not only policy change but also social change to turn the tide. Tomorrow will mark four weeks from the day that three 9-year-olds and three adults were murdered at a Christian school in Nashville. The family and friends of those who were killed will never be the same. They are only at the very beginning of a long, hard journey through deepest grief. But in many ways, our nation has moved on."
Kansas,Q2,"While clinics in some states expanded capacity, bans prevented thousands from getting legal abortions, a major new survey of abortion providers finds. The number of legal abortions in the United States decreased just over 6 percent in the six months after the Supreme Court ended the right to abortion last June, according to a report released Tuesday, the most comprehensive and up-to-date count of abortions nationwide."
Kansas,Q2,"In the campaign to ban gender therapies for minors, Republicans have amplified a group of activists who no longer identify as transgender, overriding objections from transgender people and medical experts. When Missouri lawmakers took up bills to ban transition care for minors, Chloe Cole, an activist from California, traveled to Jefferson City to offer her story as Exhibit A."
Kansas,Q2,"Temperatures will be up to 20 degrees above normal for much of the region through at least the weekend, with no nighttime relief. Even for Southerners used to spending a lot of time outside, this week’s brutal heat and humidity — which spread from Texas across the Gulf Coast and north into Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas on Wednesday — are a little much."
Kansas,Q2,"People who deem themselves judge, jury and executioner walk among us, and we have no real way of knowing when they will turn on us. Increasingly, it is not safe to be in public, to be human, to be fallible. I’m not quoting breathless journalism about rising crime or conservative talking points about America falling into ruin. The ruin I’m thinking of isn’t in San Francisco or Chicago or at the southern border. The ruin is woven into the fabric of America. It’s seeping into all of us. All across the country, supposedly good, upstanding citizens are often fatally enforcing ever-changing, arbitrary and personal norms for how we conduct ourselves."

Kansas,Q2,"Less for more. That’s the fundamental bargain, as it’s been construed since Roe v. Wade and the Reagan revolution. Here’s the American bargain: less for more. Less from the government, in exchange for more of yourself. More privacy, more speech, more ability to move wherever you might want to go and to associate with whomever you like."
Kansas,Q2,"A 15-year-old boy was among the dead and dozens more were wounded, Palestinian officials said. Eight Israeli security officers were hurt and helicopters were later deployed, the military reported. An Israeli raid into the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank turned deadly on Monday, with at least five Palestinians killed in a gun battle, and Israeli helicopter gunships were sent into the area for the first time in decades to secure forces trying to extricate armored vehicles that had been disabled by a powerful roadside bomb."
Kansas,Q2,Meet three women – all very much alive – who’ve pre-planned their funerals to insulate their families from financial hardship. 
Kansas,Q2,"Even as the nation’s drug crisis mounted, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine continued to accept funds from some members of the Sackler family, including those involved with Purdue Pharma. For the past decade, the White House and Congress have relied on the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, a renowned advisory group, to help shape the federal response to the opioid crisis, whether by convening expert panels or delivering policy recommendations and reports."
Kansas,Q2,"In an age of outrage and cynicism, a TV show calls us back to humility. Each Wednesday night my husband and I tune in to watch “Ted Lasso,” the Emmy award-winning Apple TV+ comedy series. The show’s protagonist and title character, played by Jason Sudeikis, is ebullient, kind and, though smart, persistently silly. In the pilot episode, Ted, wide-eyed and folksy, arrives in England after relocating from Kansas with his friend Coach Beard. They climb into an impossibly small car, and Ted calls out to Rebecca, his serious, conniving new boss, “Look! This car has an invisible steering wheel!,” mimicking steering on the left side of the car (as we do on this side of the pond). It’s clear that he’s a sort of clown, with this scene even hinting at a clown car shtick. We discover throughout the series that it is in this very silliness that his power is found."
Kansas,Q2,"It’s not just a dating thing, and it can hurt. A lot. Here are ways to cope — and move forward. In my late 20s, I was ghosted by one of my closest friends."
Kansas,Q2,"Ken Sim, Vancouver’s first mayor of Chinese descent, rejects claims of Chinese interference and says his landslide win was due to his tireless campaigning and more appealing policies. VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Every day when he arrives at his office in City Hall, Mayor Ken Sim stares at a prominent black-and-white photograph of Chinese railway workers toiling on the tracks in British Columbia in 1884."
Kansas,Q2,"Undeterred by arson at his home and by the murder of a colleague, he provided reproductive care in Nebraska and Maryland, including late-term abortions. LeRoy Carhart, a Midwestern doctor who became an archnemesis of abortion opponents and a leading defender of late-term abortions, died on Friday at a hospice in Bellevue, Neb., a suburb of Omaha. He was 81."
Kansas,Q2,"The Supreme Court will soon rule on race-conscious college admissions, a core Democratic issue. But an analysis of a California referendum points to a divide between the party and voters. The 2020 campaign to restore race-conscious affirmative action in California was close to gospel within the Democratic Party. It drew support from the governor, senators, state legislative leaders and a who’s who of business, nonprofit and labor elites, Black, Latino, white and Asian."
Kansas,Q2,"But advocates can’t agree on a strategy to hold more ballot initiatives. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion access has fared very well when it has appeared on the ballot."
Kansas,Q2,"Federal officials are investigating the railroad’s safety practices and culture after the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and worker deaths. Norfolk Southern once had so few accidents and injuries that it won the rail industry’s prestigious E.H. Harriman safety award for 23 years in a row until it was retired in 2012. But in the last decade, the company has gone from an industry leader to a laggard."
Kansas,Q2,We look at the costs of Dianne Feinstein’s absence to the Democratic Party’s agenda. President Biden and Senate Democrats have a numbers problem.
Kansas,Q2,"Clara Wu Tsai and Joe Tsai, the Liberty owners, improved their facilities and chartered flights, drawing a W.N.B.A. fine — and enticing top free agents. In January, Clara Wu Tsai flew to Turkey on a trip that altered the balance of power in the W.N.B.A."
Kansas,Q2,"In past instances of public criticism, the court has occasionally changed its ways. In an interview last month, Justice Samuel Alito complained about excessive criticism of the Supreme Court. To him, this criticism has not identified discrete problems to be solved but rather represent bad-faith efforts by critics to do nothing more than give the public a “reason to question our legitimacy.”"
Kansas,Q2,"Extreme heat is increasing electricity demand as people crank up the AC. The strain could be too much. It’s really hot in Texas right now. Many parts of the state are hotter than they’ve ever been at this time of year. In the coastal city of Corpus Christi, the heat index, a combined measure of heat and humidity, reached a shocking 125 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 52 Celsius."
Kansas,Q2,"Time, instead of adding to the luster of women’s sports as it does men’s, erodes it. The photograph of Muhammad Ali flexing over a fallen Sonny Liston is one of the most famous in sports history. The moment, and the image, are iconic, sold in every format imaginable, while also helping mythologize an athlete, a sport and even an era."

Kansas,Q2,"To participate, submit your response here by June 30 at 9 a.m. Eastern. This week’s winners will be announced on July 11. Update: Winners for this week have been announced."
Kansas,Q2,"A half-century ago, Elizabeth King and Elder Jack Ward recorded for D-Vine Spirituals. The label’s masters found a new home, giving their music — old and new — a second chance. When Elizabeth King & the Gospel Souls recorded their 1972 single “I Heard the Voice,” they spent hours at the tiny Tempo Studio in downtown Memphis, with the Rev. Juan D. Shipp demanding they repeat the song until they got it right."
Kansas,Q2,"The agency that runs New York City’s subway and buses has fewer riders and shaky finances. Experts have ideas for addressing the problems. Even as New York returns to something close to prepandemic life, the city’s transit system remains mired in a crisis of decreased ridership and shaky finances."
Kansas,Q2,"Many of the bills denied certain medical care to transgender people, while others targeted bathroom use and preferred personal pronouns. Statehouses around the country this year have been consumed by fights over laws governing transgender people."
Kansas,Q2,"The answer depends on how you measure success. My colleagues David Brooks and Paul Krugman have engaged in a running debate for much of their time as Times Opinion columnists, and I often find their exchanges illuminating."
Kansas,Q2,"What should we make of the role that abortion played in both the Chicago and Wisconsin elections this week? The elections this week in Chicago and Wisconsin were different in many ways. One was for mayor, the other for a state Supreme Court seat. One was in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, the other in a closely divided swing state."
Kansas,Q2,"A pastor for more than 50 years, William Greason, 98, occasionally tells tales of a lifetime ago, when he mentored Willie Mays and played in the last Negro World Series. The older pastor, wearing a long purple robe, ascended the steps to the pulpit. “God has always had a plan and a purpose for each of our lives,” the Rev. William H. Greason said in a slow, gentle voice. From the pews came affirmations of “Amen!” and “All right!”"
Kansas,Q2,The approach known as Housing First has long enjoyed bipartisan support. But conservatives are pushing efforts to replace it with programs that put more emphasis on sobriety and employment. The bipartisan approach that has dominated federal homelessness policy for more than two decades is under growing conservative attack.
Kansas,Q2,"The proposed debt cancellation of more than $400 billion would have been one of the most expensive executive actions in U.S. history. The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority with its plan to wipe out more than $400 billion in student debt, dashing the hopes of tens of millions of borrowers and imposing new restrictions on presidential power."
Kansas,Q2,"They call themselves the “Sister Senators” and three of them are Republicans. When the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, advocates on either side presumed that the country would divide along the bright color lines: red states completely banning abortion, blue states protecting it."
Kansas,Q3,"Tribal governments are heavily dependent on federal funding because of treaties guaranteeing basic services. On the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in North Dakota, the contingency planning started weeks ago."
Kansas,Q3,"Supporters of protecting abortion in the state’s Constitution submitted enough signatures to get on the November ballot. But another vote in August could make it harder to win. Ohio moved one step closer to becoming the next big test case in the nation’s fight over abortion, after supporters of a measure that would ask voters to establish a right to abortion in the state’s Constitution this week said they had filed more than enough signatures to put it on the ballot in November."
Kansas,Q3,"The drug Wegovy eased issues for people with a type of heart problem, adding to the treatment’s benefits beyond weight loss. One of the leading new obesity drugs, Wegovy, eased symptoms and raised the quality of life of patients with obesity and a common type of heart failure, a study funded by the drug’s maker found, adding to the evidence that the medications can produce health benefits beyond weight loss."
Kansas,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated. In the wake of the decision, 15 largely conservative states imposed near-total bans (through trigger laws or new legislation), and two more set limits at six weeks of pregnancy. "
Kansas,Q3,"A recent study showed that a statin drug significantly lowered the risk of heart attacks and strokes among middle-aged and older people with the virus. Americans with H.I.V. are achieving the once unthinkable: a steady march into older age. But beginning around age 50, many people living with the virus face a host of health problems, from heart disease and diabetes to social isolation and cognitive decline."
Kansas,Q3,"After Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, some feared that other court rulings, including the 2003 decision that invalidated sodomy laws, could be revisited. Maryland and Minnesota recently repealed theirs. It has been 20 years since the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws with its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, but legal codes inherited from colonial laws and used to prosecute L.G.B.T.Q. people by banning some sexual acts remain in place across the country."
Kansas,Q3,"Extensive damage occurred at the company’s property in Rocky Mount, and many products used by hospitals appeared to have been affected. This could further exacerbate shortages. A tornado caused extensive damage to a Pfizer drug manufacturing site in Rocky Mount, N.C., on Wednesday, threatening critical supplies for hospitals across the country."
Kansas,Q3,"From meatpackers to home health aides, workers are struggling in sweltering temperatures and productivity is taking a hit. As much of the United States swelters under record heat, Amazon drivers and warehouse workers have gone on strike in part to protest working conditions that can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit."
Kansas,Q3,"The Packers-Bears rivalry starts anew and the hyped-up Jets will be tested against the Bills in a strong slate of games. There is a beautiful optimism to the start of every N.F.L. season. Just about every team believes it could be this year’s version of the 2022 Giants, who surprisingly stormed to a 9-7-1 record and the playoffs. Every newly acquired player, regardless of age or recent production, is the key to overall improvement, and every player who left was probably at the end of his utility, anyway."
Kansas,Q3,"As they struggle to recover after the pandemic, regional theaters are staging fewer shows, giving fewer performances, laying off staff and, in some cases, closing. There is less theater in America these days. Fewer venues. Fewer productions. Fewer performances."
Kansas,Q3,"Dr. Brian P. Monahan has been thrust into the center of a political controversy as Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, seeks to dismiss concerns about his age and health. When Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, 81, wanted to quiet concerns about his health after two alarming on-camera episodes in which he appeared unable to speak or move, he turned to Dr. Brian P. Monahan."
Kansas,Q3,The United Auto Workers said it had “reasonably productive conversations with Ford” but did not mention G.M. or Stellantis. The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers on Saturday resumed negotiations on a new labor contract as a targeted strike entered its second day.
Kansas,Q3,"Backers of a proposal to establish a right to abortion in the Ohio Constitution submitted enough valid signatures to put the question on the November ballot. Ohio voters will decide in November whether to amend their state Constitution to establish a right to abortion, after state officials said on Tuesday that proponents had submitted over 495,000 valid signatures from voters, more than enough to put the question on the ballot."
Kansas,Q3,"The second novel by the author of “The Nix” follows a young Chicago couple’s trajectory from pre-internet optimism to 21st-century ennui. Nathan Hill’s novels are, among other things, feats of narrative architecture. “My projects are vast creatures of shocking complexity,” a real-estate developer none-too-humbly notes early in Hill’s new novel, “Wellness” — “intricate, unruly, asynchronous, a little baroque.” Given the vastness of the 600-page book that follows, one can’t help imagining the author is supplying a would-be ars poetica of his own."
Kansas,Q3,"He was never charged with the deaths of seven people from cyanide-laced Tylenol, but he was convicted of extortion after he sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson demanding $1 million to “stop the killing.” James W. Lewis, the prime suspect in the deaths of seven people in 1982 from cyanide-laced Tylenol — a poisoning that terrified the nation and changed the way manufacturers packaged medications — died on Sunday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 76."
Kansas,Q3,"PFAS lurk in so much of what we eat, drink and use. Scientists are only beginning to understand how they’re impacting our health — and what to do about them. The Faroe Islands, an incongruous speckling of green in the North Atlantic, are about as far away as you can hope to get on Earth from a toxic-waste dump, time zones distant from the nearest population centers (Norway to the east, Iceland to the west). Pál Weihe was born in the Faroes and has lived there for most of his life. He is a public-health authority for the nation, population around 53,000; chairman of the Faroese Medical Association and chief physician of the Department of Occupational Medicine and Public Health in the Faroese hospital system. He is also vice chairman of the Faroe Islands Art Society; a widower; a grandfather. A crumpled funeral program and half-empty juice boxes share space in the back seat of his Land Cruiser. "
Kansas,Q3,"The writers’ strike paralyzed the entertainment industry for months. It might be coming to end. A writers’ strike has frozen Hollywood for months. Studios delayed the production of TV shows and movies, including fan favorites like “Stranger Things” and new “Star Wars” films. Organizers postponed the Emmys. Talk shows went on hiatus."
Kansas,Q3,"What’s behind the shift in the Democratic Party’s economic policy? Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both ran for president promising to reinvigorate the economy for ordinary Americans. And both enacted laws that helped millions of people. Clinton expanded children’s health care and tax credits for low-income families. Obama accomplished even more, making it possible for almost anybody to afford health insurance."
Kansas,Q3,"The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water. The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water."
Kansas,Q3,"Aquifers are shrinking nationwide, threatening supplies of drinking water and America’s status as a food superpower. Climate change is amplifying the problem. A New York Times investigation has found that America is depleting its invaluable reserves of groundwater at a dangerous rate."
Kansas,Q3,"The Times has created a new game, and we walk you through it. When you open Connections — a new Times game — you often need to fight your initial instincts. It’s a game in which a little patience can go a long way."
Kansas,Q3,"As the Republican presidential candidates campaign under the shadow of a front-runner facing dozens of felony charges, The New York Times examined their stances on key issues. As the Republican presidential candidates campaign under the shadow of a front-runner facing dozens of felony charges, The New York Times examined their stances on key issues."
Kansas,Q3,"Also, a prison escape near Philadelphia. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. In a sharp escalation, Mayor Eric Adams declared that New York City was being destroyed by an influx of 110,000 migrants from the southern border. His comments, criticized by advocates for villainizing migrants for seeking a better life, underscored how the surge has become overwhelming."
Kansas,Q3,"He headed the journalism program at Harvard after overseeing Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Kent State shootings and corruption in Michigan. Robert H. Giles, who oversaw Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage at two newspapers — including reports on the fatal shooting of four antiwar protesters by National Guard troops on the Kent State University campus in Ohio in 1970 — and later served as curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University for more than a decade, died on Aug. 7 in Traverse City, Mich. He was 90."
Kansas,Q3,"The butter cow is a state fair institution. But the sculptors say there’s more than dairy to these pale yellow works of art. The oily visage of a butter cow is an alluring sight at state fairs across the nation, but few people have taken the time to think about what’s inside them. Warning: It’s not more butter."
Kansas,Q3,"State flags mix aesthetics and nostalgia. Flags flutter over every state capital in the U.S. They bear emblems symbolizing the states they represent: a boldface C for Colorado, a lone star for Texas. They adorn magnets, mugs and T-shirts. They fly at half-staff in mourning."
Kansas,Q3,"For the pro-life movement, persuasion is everything. On Sunday, Donald Trump sent shock waves through the Republican primary when an interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” aired in which he said that Ron DeSantis did a “terrible thing” and made a “terrible mistake” when he signed Florida’s six-week abortion ban. It’s the kind of statement that could end virtually any other Republican presidential campaign. Opposition to abortion rights, after all, is every bit as fundamental to Republican identity as support for abortion rights is to Democratic identity. Breaking with the party on that issue is the kind of heresy that no national politician can survive."
Kansas,Q3,"Randall Cobb spent a decade catching Rodgers’s passes in Green Bay. He’s using that experience to teach young Jets receivers about their new quarterback’s tendencies. On the day the Jets traded for quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, Randall Cobb posted a workout video to Instagram."
Kansas,Q3,"A downturn in the world’s second biggest economy, and growing fears about its real estate sector, are making investors jittery. Goldman Sachs economists see an end to the Fed’s hawkish policy on interest rates, predicting that the central bank will cut its prime lending rate in the second quarter of next year. But that bullish prediction is doing little to restore investors’ optimism, as concerns mount about consumer confidence and the health of global economy."
Kansas,Q3,A judge found there was “a fundamental constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.” The state of Montana has a constitutional obligation to protect its residents from climate change.
Kansas,Q3,"A major military incursion into the city of Jenin left at least 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. A Palestinian attack on Tel Aviv wounded at least eight. Israel’s military said on Wednesday that it had withdrawn from the occupied West Bank city of Jenin after a large-scale incursion that killed at least 12 Palestinians, left one Israeli soldier dead and sent thousands fleeing from their homes over the past two days."
Kansas,Q3,"An essential American art form reaches a milestone. For 50 years, the essential writing — fables, comedies, diaries; adventure, memoir, porn — about young Black life in this country has been happening in hip-hop. Songs about feelings, fantasies, dilemmas, confessions, fantasias. What else is Notorious B.I.G.’s “Ready to Die” and its grueling, knowing, melodic re-creation of moral decay and sexual congress other than a triumph of literature? It is but one title on a shelf buckling with scores of comparable powerhouses. That’s one masterpiece set in New York."
Kansas,Q3,The group discusses alternatives to Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican primaries. The group discusses alternatives to Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican primaries.
Kansas,Q3,"Ballot initiatives appear to be one of the few ways for advocates to expand abortion access in conservative states. Once again, abortion access has won a victory at the polls."
Kansas,Q3,The threat to groundwater is a classic tragedy of the commons. The water that lies beneath the earth’s surface — known as groundwater — has been a vital resource for thousands of years. Communities that are far away from lakes and rivers use groundwater to irrigate crops and provide drinking water.
Kansas,Q3,"Indictments and debate drama ensure that the primary revolves around him. There was a time, not all that long ago, when being indicted was bad for a politician’s career. That time is over — at least for Donald Trump."
Kansas,Q3,"At a time when lawmakers and parents are seeking to restrict what can and cannot be taught in classrooms, many teachers are seeing efforts to limit what can be staged in their auditoriums. Stevie Ray Dallimore, an actor and teacher, had been running the theater program for a private boys’ school in Chattanooga for a decade, but he never faced a school year like this one."
Kansas,Q3,"The union designated 38 spare-parts distribution centers as additional strike targets at General Motors and Stellantis. The United Automobile Workers union on Friday significantly raised the pressure on General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep and Ram, by expanding its strike against the companies to include all the spare-parts distribution centers of the two companies."
Kansas,Q3,"The union targeted three factories: one run by General Motors, one by Ford and one by Stellantis. Prolonged walkouts could hurt the U.S. economy and President Biden. Autoworkers walked off the job on Friday at three factories that produce some of the Detroit carmakers’ most popular vehicles, the opening salvos in what could become a protracted strike that hurts the U.S. economy and has an impact on the 2024 presidential election."
Kansas,Q3,"New York City’s leadership says housing and caring for migrants is costing billions, and “destroying” the city. But economists say their arrival will eventually be a boon. At around 7 a.m. one day last August, the first migrants sent to New York City by the governor of Texas arrived with little warning on a bus, and walked sleepily into their new lives."
Kansas,Q3,"The industry has used its muscle to prevent federal, state and local governments from penalizing companies that park freight trains across roads for hours or days. Freight trains frequently stop and block the roads of York, Ala., sometimes cutting off two neighborhoods for hours. Emergency services and health care workers can’t get in, and those trapped inside can’t get out."
Kansas,Q3,"A collision-heavy wheelchair football team in Buffalo is giving players community and purpose. Dawson Broad had been the starting quarterback for his suburban Buffalo high school, but he hadn’t played any sports since 2021, when, on his 23rd birthday, he had dived into an aboveground swimming pool and damaged his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed."
Kansas,Q3,Resistance to wind and solar projects from environmentalists is among an array of impediments to widespread conversion to renewables. Resistance to wind and solar projects from environmentalists is among an array of impediments to widespread conversion to renewables.
Kansas,Q3,How you view the crisis of men and boys — and whether you think there is one — is just one of the ways you reveal your political leanings. Competing partisan views on how we see men and masculinity are emerging as key factors in the run-up to the 2024 election.
Kansas,Q3,"New research reveals the vast scope of the Native American boarding school system, which for more than a century removed Native children from their homes and families in an effort to assimilate them. Students at the schools gave up their names, their labor and sometimes their lives. New research reveals the vast scope of the Native American boarding school system, which for more than a century removed Native children from their homes and families in an effort to assimilate them.

Kansas,Q3,"The nation’s current crisis can be traced back, in ways large and small, to the outsize personality of its longest-serving prime minister. Flanked by two bickering ministers, Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to shrivel in his seat. It was late July in the Knesset, the last week before the summer recess, but there was no anticipatory buzz in the air. While lawmakers were preparing to vote, anti-government protesters, walled off from Parliament by newly installed barbed wire, chanted “Busha!” — “Shame!” "
Kansas,Q3,The group discusses the Republican primary field in advance of the first 2024 G.O.P. debate. The group discusses the Republican primary field in advance of the first 2024 G.O.P. debate.
Kansas,Q3,"The Aug. 8, 2023, episode of “The Ezra Klein Show.” Every Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation about something that matters, like today’s episode, guest-hosted by Jane Coaston, with Ben Domenech. Listen wherever you get your podcasts."
Kansas,Q3,"The decision by Justice Arthur F. Engoron is a major victory for Attorney General Letitia James in her lawsuit against Mr. Trump, effectively deciding that no trial was needed to determine that he had fraudulently secured favorable terms on loans and insurance deals. The decision by Justice Arthur F. Engoron is a major victory for Attorney General Letitia James in her lawsuit against Mr. Trump, effectively deciding that no trial was needed to determine that he had fraudulently secured favorable terms on loans and insurance deals."
Kansas,Q4,The outcome is being closely watched by Democrats and Republicans looking to measure the strength of voter anger over the loss of federal abortion protections. Ohio voters are deciding on a ballot measure that would amend the state’s Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right to abortion.
Kansas,Q4,"The actions coincided with a period of increasing labor activism by workers in other sectors, including the auto industry and Hollywood. Some pharmacy workers are calling in sick or walking off the job this week to protest what they call inadequate staffing and increasing work requirements, according to protest organizers, and say it’s harder to do their jobs safely."
Kansas,Q4,"Adult children discuss the trials of caring for their aging parents: unreliable agencies, a lack of help and dwindling financial resources. I am 39 years old. I had to care for my father, who passed from cancer in 2019; my mother, who passed in November 2021 from cancer; and since her passing I have inherited the care of my grandmother. She is 97, diagnosed with moderate dementia and is considered high risk to be left home alone. We had been applying for Medicaid long-term care to receive a home health aide since early November 2021. She finally got a home health aide in January 2022, but it’s been a nightmare. They are so desperate to hire workers that they will take anyone. She was left without an aide on many random days with a late-notice telephone call or text message from the aide needing the day off and the agencies not able to find a replacement in time. I have changed agencies multiple times. My husband has been a great support the entire time. We rely on security cameras we installed in our apartment to see how she is doing while we are at work. How is it on a daily basis? It is emotionally and physically draining. The health care system for the elderly is neglected, broken and inadequate to meet any demands, even the basic needs."
Kansas,Q4,"A coalition of groups collecting petition signatures for a ballot protecting abortion rights says its fund-raising got a boost after the Ohio results. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, campaigns to protect abortion rights have galvanized voters in state after state. It has become Democrats’ most successful issue ahead of an uncertain 2024 election cycle — and their biggest hope, especially after voters in Ohio approved on Tuesday a measure to enshrine abortion rights in the State Constitution."
Kansas,Q4,"With post-Roe outrage showing no sign of waning, strategists on the right are pushing a new lexicon on abortion. In the year since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the Republican Party has tested out constantly changing talking points and messages on abortion in an attempt to make its anti-abortion policies sound less extreme. Conservatives are even considering moving away from the term “pro-life,” fearing that voters have newly negative associations with the label."
Kansas,Q4,"At an annual gathering in Arizona, Democratic governors offered a series of explanations for the president’s political struggles and suggested ideas for selling voters on his re-election. America’s Democratic governors brag about booming local economies, preside over ribbon-cuttings of projects paid for with new federal legislation and have successfully framed themselves as defenders of abortion rights and democracy."
Kansas,Q4,"The junior senator from California, appointed to serve out the term of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, discussed adapting to the slow pace of the Senate and her goals before leaving office in a year. Senator Laphonza Butler came to her job in Congress in an unusual way and quickly decided she was not going to stay."
Kansas,Q4,"The 19-year-old soldier was taken after Hamas gunmen overran and briefly captured a military base in Nahal Oz, just east of the northern Gaza Strip. The Israeli military said on Monday that it had rescued an Israeli soldier who was abducted from an Israeli army base on Oct. 7 and taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in Israel."
Kansas,Q4,"Dr. Connor Bowman was charged with murder after investigators found that his wife, Betty Bowman, was poisoned with a drug that he had researched online. A Minnesota doctor who the authorities said had worked as a poison specialist was arrested on Friday and charged in the death of his wife, Betty Bowman, who died in August from poisoning."
Kansas,Q4,"The connection between Philip Taylor Jr. and Kristin Dyson was so strong that they stayed until closing at a restaurant and then a wine bar. “It felt like the whole date was 10 minutes,” Ms. Dyson said. Philip Joseph Lee Taylor Jr. knows how to host a good party. He runs a roving social event series with food and music called Philinthebrunch, and it was at an event in early February 2020 at Row House, a restaurant in Harlem, where he first saw Kristin Tyler Dyson."
Kansas,Q4,"Voters’ broad discontent with disarray in Washington transcends political parties, race, age and geography. Whitney Smith’s phone buzzed with a text from her mother, alerting her to the latest can-you-believe-it mess in Washington: “Far right ousted the House speaker. Total chaos now.”"
Kansas,Q4,"Our mortality crisis is much larger than “deaths of despair.” Since it was first introduced by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton in 2015, the phrase “deaths of despair” has become a sort of spiritual skeleton key that promised to unlock the whole tragic story of a new American underclass."
Kansas,Q4,"The Israeli military said troops had uncovered a Hamas tunnel shaft underneath the Al-Shifa Hospital complex, as well as a vehicle on the hospital grounds packed with weapons. Follow live news updates on the Israel-Hamas war."
Kansas,Q4,"The United States has no coherent system for providing long-term care, leading many who are aging to struggle to stay independent or to rely on a patchwork of solutions. Margaret Newcomb, 69, a retired French teacher, is desperately trying to protect her retirement savings by caring for her 82-year-old husband, who has severe dementia, at home in Seattle. She used to fear his disease-induced paranoia, but now he’s so frail and confused that he wanders away with no idea of how to find his way home. He gets lost so often that she attaches a tag to his shoelace with her phone number."
Kansas,Q4,"Democratic candidates jumped on the story of a woman who left Texas for an abortion as a cautionary tale for voters, and Republicans were largely silent. The case of a Texas woman who sought a court-approved abortion but wound up leaving the state for the procedure is reigniting political arguments that have roiled elections for more than two years, placing Democrats on the offensive and illustrating Republicans’ continued lack of a unified policy response or clear strategy on how to talk about the issue."
Kansas,Q4,"Senator Sherrod Brown is betting that the issue will aid his re-election bid in Ohio, which recently upheld abortion rights. Allies of Senator Jon Tester of Montana are also hoping it helps. In the opening minutes of a debate during Sherrod Brown’s successful 2006 campaign for Senate, the Republican incumbent attacked him over “partial-birth abortion,” a phrase often weaponized by conservatives at the time to paint Democrats as somewhere between immoral and murderous."
Kansas,Q4,"The decision by an advisory committee may lead to Food and Drug Administration approval of the first treatment for humans that uses the CRISPR gene-editing system.

Kansas,Q4,The State Constitution will protect access to the procedure. The ballot result sends a strong signal that voters are still angry about the demise of Roe. Ohio’s resounding approval of a ballot measure enshrining a right to abortion in the State Constitution continued a winning streak for abortion-rights groups that have appealed directly to voters after the demise of Roe v. Wade.

Kansas,Q4,"Yarros drew on her experience with chronic illness and life in a military family to write “Fourth Wing,” a huge best seller that spawned a spicy fantasy series. When Rebecca Yarros pitched her publisher a sexy fantasy about telepathic dragons and their riders, she thought it might be a tough sell."
Kansas,Q4,"Overturning Roe changed politics. Overturning affirmative action did not. What do the strikingly different public responses to two recent Supreme Court rulings — one on abortion, the other on affirmative action — suggest about the prospects for the liberal agenda?"
Kansas,Q4,"Post-Roe voting might bring America to a new consensus — but only if the voters keep getting their say. As long as the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, conservatives complained that it had squelched the democratic process — that unelected men in black robes had handed down a national edict rather than letting the American people sort out a consensus."
Kansas,Q4,"Long the epitome of holiday luxury in America, the cut’s place on the table has changed with tastes — and the economy. On a biting December evening, the St. Clair Supper Club in Chicago’s West Loop neighborhood offered an escape out of the weather — and into America’s culinary past."
Kansas,Q4,"Stories about the Titan submersible, Matthew Perry and the House Speaker vote were among the most-read of the year.

Kansas,Q4,"Why the U.S. wants Israel to pause a ground invasion in Gaza. For more than a week, an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza has seemed as if it might begin any day. Troops and tanks have crowded the border. Israel has ordered Gazans to evacuate south. The military has showered missiles on Hamas bunkers to weaken the group."
Kansas,Q4,"What you need to know to charter a sailboat in the Caribbean, from costs and type of vessel to timing and itinerary.

A crew of two — part of the deal — ran the show."

Kansas,Q4,"Interest rates are making U.S. debt a bigger burden. A bipartisan commission could find solutions. You need to put politics aside to shrink government budget deficits — or that’s the conventional wisdom, anyway. Heidi Heitkamp disagrees. Heitkamp, who served one term in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat from the red state North Dakota, argues that it’s impossible to cut deficits and restrain the growth of the national debt without politics."

Kansas,Q4,"He helped change the trajectory of rock music with Sonic Youth. But in his new memoir, “Sonic Life,” he’d rather talk about the musicians who enriched his world. When Thurston Moore was 10 years old, his family relocated from South Miami, Fla., to Bethel, Conn. His father taught art appreciation, philosophy, humanities and phenomenology at Western Connecticut State University, and it soon became clear to young Thurston that his upbringing was unlike those of his peers in the suburban town."
Kansas,Q4,"Why some people decide to send their remains into orbit. There are two ways to contemplate the question Where do we go when we die? One is philosophical, ultimately unanswerable; the other is logistical. Humans, being human, have tended to see them as being intertwined: The many traditions we’ve devised for handling our remains are meant to honor the selves that left those bodies behind. "

Kansas,Q4,"What primed some evangelical Christians to think in apocalyptic terms about America? Jane Coaston interviews Tim Alberta about Donald Trump, Covid and Christianity. Roughly 24 percent of Americans consider themselves born again or evangelical, but what that means — spiritually, culturally, politically — depends on whom you ask.

Kentucky,Q1,"The agency wants Congress to intervene, saying it does not have adequate oversight powers to ensure the safety of the myriad cannabidiol products derived from hemp. Four years after Congress legalized hemp, spawning a vast, unregulated market for cannabidiol-infused beverages, gummies and lotions, the Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it lacked the authority to regulate such products. Instead, the agency called on federal lawmakers to give it a stronger regulatory framework to address the health claims and safety concerns that have dogged the prolific CBD industry."
Kentucky,Q1,"Stop-and-go federal funding floods public health agencies with cash during crises but starves them of funds afterward. The coronavirus pandemic shows the pitfalls of that approach. JACKSON, Miss. — When the coronavirus first scythed through the nation in early 2020, few places needed help fighting it more than Scott County, Miss., a rural patch of chicken processing plants and pine forests an hour east of the state capital, Jackson."

Kentucky,Q1,"Senator Chuck Schumer says the party’s main priority will be to make certain that sweeping laws of the past two years are implemented — and that Democrats get credit. WASHINGTON — With major legislation likely to be rare in a divided Congress, Senate Democrats are planning to put much of their effort over the next two years into selling the impact of laws they have already passed, heralding the benefits and making sure that tens of billions of federal dollars are spent appropriately and in a way that gives them a political advantage."
Kentucky,Q1,"Despite a wave of new research around cancer treatment and sexual health, women say their issues are still being dismissed. Here’s how and where to get help. Débora Lindley López was 28 when she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. Within three weeks, she began chemotherapy and was thrust into medically induced menopause. Ms. Lindley López developed vaginal dryness so severe that her skin began to deteriorate and was covered in small, paper cut-like tears. Urinating was uncomfortable; sex, agonizing."
Kentucky,Q1,"The relationships between big cities and rural-dominated legislatures have often been hostile. But a rift between Nashville and the Tennessee Legislature suggests the nation’s partisan divide is making things worse. WASHINGTON — Rural legislators have looked down on big cities, and urban pols have returned the favor, since the farmer-statesman Thomas Jefferson called urban areas “pestilential to the morals, the health and the liberties of man.” But for most of American history, the rivalry has played out in state politics more so as a matter of parochial divisions than national ones."
Kentucky,Q1,"The Senate minority leader had been under observation since suffering a concussion during a fall on Wednesday. He also has a “minor rib fracture,” his office said. WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader who suffered a concussion in a serious fall last week, was released from the hospital on Monday and will move to a physical rehabilitation center before returning to the Senate, according to his office."
Kentucky,Q1,"The measure is part of a wave of legislation by conservative lawmakers across the country against drag performances. Many are wondering how it will be applied. NASHVILLE — A bill signed into law this week in Tennessee makes staging “adult cabaret” on public property or anywhere a child could see it a criminal offense. The law forbids performances in those places by topless, go-go or exotic dancers, strippers, or male or female impersonators who, as the law defines it, provides entertainment that is “harmful to minors.” "
Kentucky,Q1,"The state is taking action against three major drug companies and the big pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to temper costs for people with diabetes. Many Americans with diabetes still struggle to pay for their insulin, even though Medicare placed a cap on co-payments this month."
Kentucky,Q1,"The government will strictly limit in drinking water two chemicals that are ubiquitous in modern society but are linked to a range of health effects. WASHINGTON — For the first time, the federal government will require utilities to remove from drinking water two toxic chemicals found in everything from waterproof clothing to dental floss and even toilet paper, the Environmental Protection Agency announced on Tuesday."
Kentucky,Q1,"The dark growth, fed by alcohol vapors from barrels of aging Jack Daniel’s whiskey, has coated homes, cars, patio furniture and road signs in a sooty crust, residents said. One woman is suing Lincoln County. The ethanol-fueled fungus known as whiskey fungus has thrived for centuries around distilleries and bakeries. It’s been the source of complaints from residents who live near Kentucky bourbon distilleries, Canadian whiskey makers and Caribbean rum manufacturers."
Kentucky,Q1,"Members of Congress are pressing for changes to the law and the Biden administration’s approach as federal and state enforcement agencies begin a crackdown on companies that employ underage migrants. Members of Congress are pressing for stricter laws to prevent and penalize the use of child labor and tougher vetting by the Biden administration of adults who take custody of unaccompanied migrant children, as revelations about the exploitation of underage migrants by employers have prompted outrage among policymakers."
Kentucky,Q1,"In a time of strained capacity, the “hospital at home” movement is figuring out how to create an inpatient level of care anywhere. Manuelita Romero sipped cranberry juice as she lay in her bed, surrounded by pillows, blanketed under a soft white cover patterned with blue-and-green flowers. She was 92 and wearing pearl earrings and a necklace of rosary beads. Her bedroom, in a sandy, one-story adobe-style house in southwestern Albuquerque that she shared with one of her sons, was decorated with figures of saints and angels, along with more than a dozen crosses. Perfume bottles, hair spray and tubes of lotion crowded the top of her gold-trimmed cream dresser. Her house was very small but cheery and cozy, with crochet, flannel and serape coverings on the furniture and bright lemon-yellow cabinets in the kitchen."

Kentucky,Q1,"The review, undertaken after a specialized unit killed Breonna Taylor in a botched raid in 2020, paints a damning portrait of a department in crisis. WASHINGTON — The police department in Louisville, Ky., engaged in a far-ranging pattern of discriminatory and abusive law enforcement practices, the Justice Department said on Wednesday after conducting a two-year investigation prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor by the police in 2020."
Kentucky,Q1,"States can enshrine a constitutional right that the Supreme Court eliminated. The new Republican majority will soon wield power in the House of Representatives, and despite the divisions over their choice of a speaker, make no mistake: They are bent on stymieing not only President Biden’s agenda, but also efforts to protect the constitutional rights of Americans that have been whittled away by the Supreme Court and Republican-led states. Among those rights is the freedom of reproductive choice and bodily autonomy for women, which fell with the court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade last June."
Kentucky,Q1,The killings are a symptom of a deeper societal problem: the continued rise of “deaths of despair.” The killings are a symptom of a deeper societal problem: the continued rise of “deaths of despair.”
Kentucky,Q1,"A Supreme Court ruling paved the way for college athletes to earn financial payments. But a governing body’s neglect means the players are still powerless pawns. The N.C.A.A. is the easiest target in sports, and that’s entirely its own fault. Decades of defending a system premised on the unpaid labor of its athletes — a system that Walter Byers, one of its architects, later regretfully compared to a “neo-plantation” — has whittled the N.C.A.A.’s credibility to near nonexistence."
Kentucky,Q1,"Many of the legal arguments seeking to overturn abortion bans rely on rights provided by the states, and how they are interpreted by state supreme courts. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in June, it declared that it was sending the issue back to the “people and their elected representatives.” But the fight has largely moved to a different set of supreme courts and constitutions: those in the states."
Kentucky,Q1,"AbbVie for years delayed competition for its blockbuster drug Humira, at the expense of patients and taxpayers. The monopoly is about to end. In 2016, a blockbuster drug called Humira was poised to become a lot less valuable."
Kentucky,Q1,"“Granny flats” are popping up in backyards across the country, affording Americans a new housing option. Some communities are not happy about it. Forty-five years ago, Betty Szudy and her wife, Maggie Roth, both 70, bought a Craftsman bungalow in Oakland, Calif. In 2017, at the same time their son and his wife were fruitlessly searching for an affordable apartment in the neighborhood, California was liberalizing its housing laws to encourage so-called accessory dwelling units, or A.D.U.s."
Kentucky,Q1,"Departing longtime lawmakers perceive little prospect of orderly business in a divided Congress. They’re taking with them decades of experience in the day-to-day work of keeping the government running. WASHINGTON — Seated in his rapidly emptying office, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, ticked through the frustrations that had piled up in recent years: party leaders devaluing committee work, an institution reluctant to embrace new ideas and unnamed colleagues unwilling to collaborate or brush up on the details of legislation."
Kentucky,Q1,"Jared Moskowitz worked closely with the Florida governor as his emergency management czar. Now, he’s joining Congress. When Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida — who was sworn in for a second term on Tuesday — tapped Jared Moskowitz to run the state’s disaster-relief agency in 2018, he praised him as “an effective Democratic voice in the Republican-dominated Legislature.”"
Kentucky,Q1,The backtracking by the Florida Republican came after bipartisan criticism and signaled how completely the G.O.P. has pulled away from calls to overhaul the nation’s entitlement programs. WASHINGTON — Senator Rick Scott of Florida finally recognized this week what leading figures in his party had been telling him for a year: Most Republicans no longer wish to discuss cutting Social Security and Medicare as a way to balance the federal budget and bring down the soaring debt.
Kentucky,Q1,The move seeks to help more women join the work force as industry leaders complain of labor shortages. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration plans to leverage the federal government’s expansive investment in the semiconductor industry to make progress on another goal: affordable child care.
Kentucky,Q1,"A renewed focus on fiscal restraint in the standoff with Democrats poses its own political risks. WASHINGTON — At a news conference this month to showcase how Republicans will handle their looming debt ceiling showdown with Democrats, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin was asked to explain what specific spending cuts his party would support in exchange for lifting the borrowing cap."
Kentucky,Q1,"The Treasury Department said it would begin a series of accounting moves to keep the U.S. from breaching its borrowing cap and asked Congress to raise or suspend the limit. WASHINGTON — The United States hit its debt limit on Thursday, prompting the Treasury Department to begin using a series of accounting maneuvers to ensure the federal government can keep paying its bills ahead of what’s expected to be a protracted fight over whether to increase the borrowing cap."
Kentucky,Q1,"The issue is no longer a political hammer for the right. In decades past, as the calendar turned to January, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade would come into view. Abortion opponents would be planning to acknowledge the date with the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. Supporters of abortion rights would schedule seminars or meet for quiet conversations about whether and when the Supreme Court might actually go so far as to repudiate the decision it issued 50 years ago on Jan. 22, 1973."
Kentucky,Q1,"Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, shreds a tired trope about working moms. Jacinda Ardern, the 42-year-old prime minister of New Zealand, announced this week that she would step down by Feb. 7. Ardern, who is also the mother of a 4-year-old girl, said that after more than five years in office, she didn’t have the energy to continue in the role. “I know what this job takes,” she said, “and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It is that simple” — cueing up a fresh round of discussion about whether women can really “have it all.”"
Kentucky,Q1,"The justices found that the state’s Constitution does not include a right to the procedure, bringing an end to a monthslong legal battle. Idaho’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition on abortion in a ruling Thursday night that said the State Constitution does not include a right to the procedure."
Kentucky,Q1,"Her Denver bookstore, the Tattered Cover, was among the country’s best, and she often found herself in the midst of First Amendment fights. In 1995 the writer A.E. Hotchner presented Joyce Meskis, owner of the Tattered Cover Book Store in Denver, with a PEN American Center award recognizing her efforts on behalf of freedom of speech and expression."
Kentucky,Q1,"One generation’s impact on the work force. The U.S. job market has staged a remarkable rebound since the start of the pandemic almost three years ago. The latest government data, released on Friday, showed that 2022 was the second-best year on record in terms of raw job growth, behind only 2021."
Kentucky,Q1,"Both U.S. political parties are now open to the idea that Covid may have come from a lab in China. A new House committee investigating the origins of Covid opened its first public hearing yesterday with plenty of political theater. Republicans accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of covering up the virus’s origins, and Democrats criticized those claims as biased and unsubstantiated. But lawmakers displayed bipartisan agreement on one point: The virus really may have come from a laboratory in China."
Kentucky,Q1,"The centrist West Virginia Democrat, who faces re-election in 2024, has made it clear he believes he can help broker a compromise to raise the debt ceiling. WASHINGTON — As Democrats unleashed relentless criticism against Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week, portraying him as a reckless politician willing to force the country into default and slash bedrock entitlement programs, one of their own spoke up in the top Republican’s defense: Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia."
Kentucky,Q1,"It is rare for jurors to visit crime scenes, and doing so can be a risk for both the prosecution and defense. Closing arguments were scheduled for later on Wednesday. ISLANDTON, S.C. — The vast estate is as idyllic as it is secluded, its fishing pond, expansive farmland and four-bedroom home shrouded by trees and a winding driveway that keep it all out of view from the highway."

Kentucky,Q1,"The state, which is near others with abortion bans and restrictions, has had a 37 percent rise in abortions since the constitutional right to abortion was overturned. RALEIGH, N.C. — Clinic by clinic, county by county and up to the highest levels of state government, no state embodies the nation’s post-Roe upheaval like North Carolina."
Kentucky,Q1,"Snoring and conflicting schedules are top reasons couples decide to sleep in separate bedrooms. Sex therapists and marriage counselors have their doubts about the arrangement. In the spring of 2022, as Valerie Weisler was preparing to move to New York City to live with her partner, she realized she wanted her own bedroom. She’d been living alone while in graduate school in Ireland, and the idea of sharing a bedroom, even with a partner, filled her with dread. But the alternative filled her with self-doubt."
Kentucky,Q1,"New budget projections show that the program’s spending is outpacing tax revenues as an aging population claims benefits. WASHINGTON — President Biden scored an early political point this month in his fight with congressional Republicans over taxes, spending and raising the federal debt limit: He forced Republican leaders to profess, repeatedly, that they will not seek cuts to Social Security and Medicare."
Kentucky,Q1,"The president said he would not veto legislation he had opposed that would thwart a new District of Columbia criminal code that reduces some sentences, as crime gains potency as a political issue. WASHINGTON — President Biden said on Thursday that he would not stand in the way of a Republican-led proposal to block a new criminal code for the District of Columbia, steering clear of a veto fight over a measure he had opposed in a move that underscored the rising political potency of public alarm about violent crime."

We’ll also find out about Mayor Eric Adams’s decision to lift the vaccine mandate for city employees.
Kentucky,Q1,"The March for Life, held each year for a half-century, should be a celebration now that Roe v. Wade has fallen. Instead, anti-abortion activists are split over what comes next.

Wade and is held every year to urge its end."

Kentucky,Q1,"Shares in the bank, a go-to funder of tech start-ups, have fallen more than 60 percent in the past day as investors fear for its finances, and those of similarly sized lenders. Shares in U.S. banks appear poised to slide again on Friday, after the sector suffered a $52 billion sell-off on Thursday, its worst drop in three years. Driving investor concerns is the health of Silicon Valley Bank, one of the biggest lenders to tech start-ups, which is urgently raising cash to shore up its finances."

An article on Friday about the only Black participant in the first national spelling bee competition referred incorrectly to Zaila Avant-garde. She was the first Black American to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee, not the first Black student to do so. (Jody-Anne Maxwell of Jamaica won the bee in 1998.)"
Kentucky,Q2,"In lawsuits challenging state abortion bans, lawyers for abortion rights plaintiffs are employing religious liberty arguments the Christian right has used for decades. For years, conservative Christians have used the principle of religious freedom to prevail in legal battles on issues like contraceptive insurance mandates and pandemic restrictions. Now, abortion rights supporters are employing that argument to challenge one of the right’s most prized accomplishments: state bans on abortion."
Kentucky,Q2,"Christina Caron, a reporter for the Well section of The New York Times, asked readers how mass shootings had affected them. More than 600 people responded. As of mid-April, there have been at least 145 mass shootings in the United States in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks gun violence. (The group defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are killed or injured.) And mass shootings represent just a small fraction of shootings nationwide. How has this pervasive violence affected our mental states or changed the way we live?"
Kentucky,Q2,"The requirements helped end the public health emergency. But they also prompted a politically charged debate.

Kentucky,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults.

Kentucky,Q2,"The Biden administration is asking states to use Medicaid funds to cover opioid addiction treatment in correctional facilities, where many people suffer intense cravings and withdrawal. The Biden administration this week accelerated efforts to fund opioid addiction treatment in jails and prisons, a core part of its drug policy agenda, calling on states to adopt a novel Medicaid program that will cover health care for incarcerated people."
Kentucky,Q2,"Some in the party are urging compromise, warning of dire electoral consequences for 2024, while other stances, on guns and gay rights, also risk turning off moderates. Republican leaders have followed an emboldened base of conservative activists into what increasingly looks like a political cul-de-sac on the issue of abortion — a tightly confined absolutist position that has limited their options ahead of the 2024 election season, even as some in the party push for moderation."
Kentucky,Q2,"The legislation, which includes an exemption for people already receiving treatment, now goes to the desk of the Republican governor. In the waning days of their legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday that would ban transition care for transgender youth."
Kentucky,Q2,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Kentucky,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors. Ten states in the past three months have passed laws prohibiting what is known as gender-affirming care for young people, in a rapid effort by Republican lawmakers across the country."
Kentucky,Q2,For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted. For-profit sellers are meeting the demand for unregulated abortion pills — one that will only grow if legal access in the U.S. is further restricted.
Kentucky,Q2,"Also, authorities are looking for a motive in a Texas shooting. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. Lawyers delivered closing arguments today in E. Jean Carroll’s lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of battery and defamation. The jury in Manhattan will begin deliberating tomorrow. "
Kentucky,Q2,"More companies are pushing low-calorie, sugar-free beverages they say are healthy. Some servings have nearly the same level of caffeine as a six-pack of Coca-Cola. It has been more than 25 years since Red Bull hit the market and introduced caffeinated energy drinks to the United States. While the company claimed its beverage would “give you wings,” it never said it was actually good for people."
Kentucky,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Kentucky,Q2,"The current and potential 2024 presidential candidates showed strong support for gun owners’ rights — a core issue for the party’s base, but one that can be a tougher sell in a general election. They cited Scripture and issued calls for prayer. They applauded law enforcement and demanded tighter security in schools. They lamented the nation’s mental health crisis and offered tough talk about the death penalty."
Kentucky,Q2,"In an era of expertly manicured fields and shared knowledge among groundskeepers, crews have an unexpected tool in their arsenal: the ban on infield shifts. Greg Elliott, the forward-thinking head groundskeeper for the San Francisco Giants, flies a drone over the pristine grass at Oracle Park five days a week. The device is equipped with an infrared camera that measures the stress levels and overall health of the turf. In the first two months of this season, Elliott had detected a notable difference from the previous two years."
Kentucky,Q2,"Regulators are raising concerns about compounded semaglutide. When Carrie Davis found out that her health insurance wouldn’t cover Ozempic, she sought an alternate route to getting the diabetes drug, which is increasingly being used off-label for weight loss. Ms. Davis, 55, did not have diabetes, but had gained 50 pounds during menopause and developed hypothyroidism, she said, and was eager to lose weight."
Kentucky,Q2,"Bipartisan support now exists for a once-radical approach to drugs. For decades, the U.S. focused on trying to scare people away from drugs, instituting tough criminal penalties and emphasizing law enforcement over addiction treatment."
Kentucky,Q2,"After abortion rights supporters swept six ballot measures last year, Republican legislatures seek to make it harder to get on the ballot, and harder to win if there is a vote. Voters pushed back decisively after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, approving ballot measures that established or upheld abortion rights in all six states where they appeared."
Kentucky,Q2,"Also, the Wagner chief threatens to withdraw fighters. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. The American labor market is proving to be unexpectedly resilient despite some big headwinds, including the Federal Reserve’s attempts to slow down the economy by hiking interest rates."
Kentucky,Q2,The approach known as Housing First has long enjoyed bipartisan support. But conservatives are pushing efforts to replace it with programs that put more emphasis on sobriety and employment. The bipartisan approach that has dominated federal homelessness policy for more than two decades is under growing conservative attack.
Kentucky,Q2,"But advocates can’t agree on a strategy to hold more ballot initiatives. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion access has fared very well when it has appeared on the ballot."
Kentucky,Q2,The new surge at the U.S.-Mexico border highlights a broader reality about immigration policy. The surge of migrants gathering at the U.S.-Mexico border underscores a point that Democratic Party politicians often try to play down: U.S. border policy has a big effect on how many people try to enter the country illegally.
Kentucky,Q2,"President Biden said he would meet with lawmakers on May 9 to discuss ways to avoid a default. WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Monday that the United States could run out of money to pay its bills by June 1 if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit, putting pressure on President Biden and lawmakers to reach a swift agreement to avoid defaulting on the nation’s debt."
Kentucky,Q2,"A gunman killed at least eight people at a mall in Texas yesterday. A gunman opened fire at a crowded mall north of Dallas yesterday, killing at least eight people and wounding seven others before he was shot to death, the authorities said. The shooting was the second-deadliest in the U.S. this year."
Kentucky,Q2,"House Republicans want every major rule to come up for a vote. That could be a recipe for no regulations at all. Government agencies have proposed dozens of major regulations so far this year. One specifies the kinds of operating cords that can be used on custom window coverings, and another would effectively require carmakers to transition two-thirds of all new passenger cars to electric technology."
Kentucky,Q2,"After Republicans passed a bill that pairs spending cuts and fossil fuel support with raising the nation’s borrowing cap, the president must decide when and how to negotiate WASHINGTON — This week’s vote by House Republicans to couple deep spending cuts with an agreement to raise the debt limit for one year has put President Biden on the defensive, forcing him to confront a series of potentially painful choices at a perilous economic moment."
Kentucky,Q2,"He started out in the Southern Baptist Convention, but when that group took a sharp conservative turn he became a voice for tolerance and diversity. The Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, who started his career in the Southern Baptist Convention but became increasingly troubled as the denomination grew more aggressively conservative, and who went on to lead the Interfaith Alliance, an organization devoted to religious and cultural diversity and to keeping religion and politics separate, died on June 7 in Monroe, La. He was 81."
Kentucky,Q2,"In their first meeting in three months, the president and House speaker remained at loggerheads over the debt ceiling and spending cuts. But they agreed to meet again. President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy emerged from a critical meeting at the White House on Tuesday with no consensus on how to end their impasse over the federal debt and spending just weeks before the nation is set to default on its obligations for the first time."
Kentucky,Q2,"A big retrospective bypassed New York recently but two gallery exhibitions, at 52 Walker and Michael Rosenfeld, more than make up for it. Few painters have used color as vigorously or as variously as Bob Thompson, the remarkable, driven American artist who was born in Louisville, Ky., in 1937, and died in Rome on the brink of his 29th birthday in 1966, worn down by ill health, substance abuse and a seemingly relentless work ethic. But Thompson never doubted his talent and had a voracious appetite for culture in many forms: He consorted with New York’s Beat poets and its free jazz musicians as well as a broad range of artists. His career lasted barely eight years, but he left behind several hundred paintings, drawings and oil studies — a fabulous horde whose magnitude is still not well known."
Kentucky,Q2,"House Republicans narrowly passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling while cutting spending by nearly 14 percent over a decade. President Biden has vowed to veto the measure. WASHINGTON — The House on Wednesday narrowly passed Republicans’ bill to raise the debt ceiling while cutting spending and unraveling major elements of President Biden’s domestic agenda, in a G.O.P. bid to force Mr. Biden to negotiate over spending reductions or risk a catastrophic debt default."
Kentucky,Q2,"Elected officials have pushed vocational programs at the expense of the liberal arts. That’s hurting America. Is a university a university without the liberal arts? Marymount University seems to think so. The institution’s trustees voted unanimously in February to eliminate majors in mathematics, art, English, history and philosophy, among other fields."
Kentucky,Q2,"The final vote on Thursday night came after leaders put down a revolt by some senators who raised concerns that the debt-limit package would under-fund the Pentagon. After weeks of political impasse, tense negotiations and mounting economic anxiety, the Senate gave final approval on Thursday night to bipartisan legislation suspending the debt limit and imposing new spending caps, sending it to President Biden and ending the possibility of a calamitous government default."
Kentucky,Q2,"Take some seasonal inspiration from what readers of The Morning are planning. Years ago, I received a voicemail from the neighborhood cobbler telling me my shoes were ready to pick up. The message was perfunctory, left by the shop owner, a usually grumpy guy who sounded like his usually grumpy self. But instead of ending with “OK, bye” or “have a good day” or some other cliché, he signed off with “Enjoy your time.”"
Kentucky,Q2,"The Manhattan case isn’t Trump’s only legal problem. In the coming months, Donald Trump’s mounting legal troubles could get even worse. At least three investigations could bring more criminal charges against him."
Kentucky,Q2,"As prices rise and seasoned help is harder to find, some restaurants are trying to provide a more welcoming experience for their underwhelmed guests. The Marte family took a risk the other night. They went out to eat."
Kentucky,Q2,"Fed up with the lack of clear college pricing and other data, these parents hacked the information they needed into usable tools and guides. Here’s a personal finance pop quiz with an extremely high pass rate."
Kentucky,Q2,"Hundreds of laws have been proposed in state legislatures across the country. In this lesson, students explore these bills and their implications. Featured Article: “G.O.P. State Lawmakers Push a Growing Wave of Anti-Transgender Bills” by Maggie Astor (Note: You can also listen to this article.)"
Kentucky,Q2,"With the right and the left up in arms about the agreement in principle reached by the president and the speaker, both sides started to make the case for its quick passage, a tall order in Congress. A day after striking a deal in principle with President Biden to suspend the debt limit, Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his leadership team began an all-out sales pitch on Sunday to rally Republicans behind a compromise that was drawing intense resistance from the hard right."
Kentucky,Q2,"Battles in 2011 and 2013 taught President Biden not to lean on a House speaker who has little room to negotiate and to keep debt ceiling talks separate from the budget. As a debt limit crisis loomed in 2011, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. described early negotiations with Republicans as civil, at one point suggesting that the process was about finding out who was willing to trade their side’s bicycle for the other side’s golf clubs."
Kentucky,Q2,"The Republican-led chamber moved to refer articles of impeachment to two House committees, charging that the president’s immigration policies are an impeachable offense. The Republican-led House on Thursday quashed a move to quickly impeach President Biden but voted along party lines to open an investigation into his removal, as reluctant G.O.P. leaders bowed to a member of their hard-right flank who demanded to move forward with charges that his immigration policies constitute high crimes and misdemeanors."
Kentucky,Q2,"The Democratic congressman has made a habit of brashly confronting Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene, often in public displays meant to attract attention. Many of his colleagues had already left for the night, but as Representative Jamaal Bowman, Democrat of New York, stepped out onto the Capitol steps on Wednesday, he had business left to do: heckling Republicans."
Kentucky,Q2,"The Minneapolis Police may agree to court-enforced federal oversight. Experts say it can lead to improvements, though defining success can be difficult. As demonstrations over police brutality rocked the country in 2020 following the death of George Floyd, Newark was held up as a model of police reform, a department so transformed by federal intervention that its officers had not fired a single shot that year."
Kentucky,Q2,"Come for the crown jewels and gold stagecoach; stay for the questions about the monarchy’s relevance. On the “how interested are you in the royal family?” spectrum, which runs from antipathy to adoration, I’m in the mildly curious range: I know who the major players are; I watched the Harry and Meghan documentary but not “The Crown.” I cannot help but feel some affinity with a person (Queen Elizabeth II) who allegedly invented an indisputably adorable dog breed (the dorgi, a cross between a dachshund and a Welsh corgi)."
Kentucky,Q2,"The president has no immediate plans to barnstorm key states with large rallies. He will instead try to burnish his record, and hope Republican infighting continues. President Biden has formally moved from a campaign-in-waiting to a campaign of waiting."
Kentucky,Q3,"Dianne Feinstein, 90, has struggled to navigate the Senate this year after suffering a severe case of shingles in February. Senator Dianne Feinstein has died at 90. Read the latest updates here."
Kentucky,Q3,"Congress has long been an institution that runs on seniority and rewards longevity, and these veteran lawmakers are still running the country at an age when most people are well into retirement. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the 81-year-old longtime Republican leader, has batted away questions about his health after twice freezing on camera, insisting he has no plans to step down ahead of schedule as the leader of his party in the Senate."
Kentucky,Q3,"The brief statement came from the attending physician of Congress, who said he had reached the conclusion after consulting with the top Republican’s doctors and didn’t say he had examined the senator. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, on Thursday released a letter from the attending physician of Congress pronouncing him “medically clear” to continue his schedule as planned, a day after the Kentucky Republican froze up suddenly at a news conference in what appeared to be a medical episode similar to one he had on camera last month."
Kentucky,Q3,"Dr. Brian P. Monahan has been thrust into the center of a political controversy as Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, seeks to dismiss concerns about his age and health. When Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, 81, wanted to quiet concerns about his health after two alarming on-camera episodes in which he appeared unable to speak or move, he turned to Dr. Brian P. Monahan."
Kentucky,Q3,"The country musician has sung about racial violence and made a video depicting a queer love story. His new album, “Rustin’ in the Rain,” was inspired by his roots — and Elvis Presley. There are parts of Kentucky where the ground is pruned and prettied, and there are parts where the grass just grows. During the early days of his career, Tyler Childers had one foot in both — as a kid from rural Lawrence County doing landscape work for a Lexington mill while he played country music for whoever would listen. One night, his worlds converged. Asked to perform at the office Christmas party, he dressed up in a tie and good shoes. He thought he looked sharp until an older man stopped to crack a joke."
Kentucky,Q3,"Undoing hospital monopolies may be a lost cause. When Mark Finney moved to southwestern Virginia with his young family a decade ago, there were different hospital systems and a range of independent doctors to choose from."
Kentucky,Q3,"The woman had sought medical help for over an hour before giving birth, officials said. The episode, which has drawn criticism, highlights issues about the incarceration of pregnant women. A woman gave birth alone in a jail cell in Tennessee on Tuesday after seeking medical attention for more than an hour, the authorities said, raising questions about the care provided to the woman and her baby."
Kentucky,Q3,"The longtime Democratic leader, who has served in the House for close to four decades, also left the door open to running again. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Senator Dianne Feinstein for remaining in office after a series of health issues, dismissing concerns about Ms. Feinstein’s continued ability to serve as a sexist double standard."
Kentucky,Q3,"Mayor Jacob Frey’s order, arriving amid a broad rethinking about the value of psychedelic drugs, makes some of them the lowest priority for the Minneapolis police. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis issued an executive order on Friday instructing the city’s police officers to, in essence, look the other way when it comes to the purchase and use of certain illegal psychedelic drugs."
Kentucky,Q3,"Some say the facilities, which focus on autonomy in childbirth, could lead to better health outcomes — but officials are tightening rules, citing risk. Gabrielle Glaze felt scolded and shamed when she delivered her first son in a Birmingham, Ala., hospital, forced to observe strict rules about lying stationary through her contractions and enduring countless cervical checks from “total strangers” who seemed disappointed by her body’s progress."
Kentucky,Q3,"After Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, some feared that other court rulings, including the 2003 decision that invalidated sodomy laws, could be revisited. Maryland and Minnesota recently repealed theirs. It has been 20 years since the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws with its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, but legal codes inherited from colonial laws and used to prosecute L.G.B.T.Q. people by banning some sexual acts remain in place across the country."
Kentucky,Q3,"A Georgia judge who had temporarily blocked the ban put her ruling on hold after a federal court struck down an injunction on a similar law in Alabama. A federal judge in Georgia has allowed the state’s ban on gender transition care for minors to go back into full effect, after a federal appeals court panel allowed a similar law in Alabama to be enforced. Before the appellate ruling, the same judge, Sarah Geraghty, had granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked part of the Georgia ban."
Kentucky,Q3,"Since she stepped down from leadership last year, many observers expected Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to head toward retirement. But she has kept people guessing about her future. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who served for decades as the Democratic Party’s House leader and was the first woman to become speaker, announced on Friday that she would seek re-election in 2024, ending months of speculation about her political future."
Kentucky,Q3,"Laws in 20 states have left the fate of clinics in doubt and families with transgender children searching for medical care across state lines. David and Wendy Batchelder hate the thought of putting their spacious house in West Des Moines, Iowa, on the market, disrupting the routines of their six children or giving up the Lutheran church that they have attended for roughly a decade."
Kentucky,Q3,"Lawyers for the family of Irvo Otieno say he died of asphyxiation after deputies and medical staff members piled on top of him at a psychiatric hospital in March. The family of a Virginia man who died after he was handcuffed and pinned to the floor by sheriff’s deputies and medical staff members for about 11 minutes earlier this year at a state psychiatric hospital has settled a lawsuit for $8.5 million with the state, county and sheriff’s office."
Kentucky,Q3,"Backers of a proposal to establish a right to abortion in the Ohio Constitution submitted enough valid signatures to put the question on the November ballot. Ohio voters will decide in November whether to amend their state Constitution to establish a right to abortion, after state officials said on Tuesday that proponents had submitted over 495,000 valid signatures from voters, more than enough to put the question on the ballot."
Kentucky,Q3,"An uptick in hospitalizations and deaths persists, but the numbers are relatively low and new vaccines are around the corner. Jill Biden, the first lady, tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has announced that the state will send high-quality masks and rapid tests to school districts that request them. Already, schools in Kentucky and Texas have closed, citing widespread respiratory illness among students and staff."
Kentucky,Q3,"New York racing officials, addressing a deepening concern for the industry, say they will use diagnostic technology and synthetic tracks to keep horses safe. It has become an all-too-common scenario: a thoroughbred suffers a ghastly injury before a packed grandstand and a national television audience and has to be euthanized by injection on the track. This past Saturday at Saratoga Race Course, an undefeated colt named New York Thunder was just strides from winning a $500,000 stakes race when he stumbled and unseated his rider."
Kentucky,Q3,"As fentanyl overdoses in public spaces spike, the lifesaving drug Narcan is being stocked by more and more bars and restaurants. Kevin Foehrkolb was tending bar on a routine Saturday night last September at Kent House Irish Pub in Towson, Md., when he heard a commotion from the corner booth where a group of regular customers were playing the card game Magic: The Gathering."
Kentucky,Q3,"Senators steered clear of the social policy dictates that sapped Democratic support for the House bill, but the legislation was headed for a contentious negotiation to reach a final agreement. The Senate on Thursday gave overwhelming approval to the annual defense policy bill, sidestepping a contentious debate over abortion access for service members and quashing efforts to limit aid for Ukraine in a show of bipartisanship that set up a bitter showdown with the House."
Kentucky,Q3,"In eight states, the estimated number of abortions increased by 60 percent or more as patients crossed state lines seeking care. In eight states, the estimated number of abortions increased by 60 percent or more as patients crossed state lines seeking care."
Kentucky,Q3,"The singer, who brings her autobiographical show to Broadway this month, on her longtime love for the Kansas City Chiefs and what she’s looking forward to in New York. Melissa Etheridge has lived a lot of life. So much so that the early version of her autobiographical show was four or five hours long."
Kentucky,Q3,"From meatpackers to home health aides, workers are struggling in sweltering temperatures and productivity is taking a hit. As much of the United States swelters under record heat, Amazon drivers and warehouse workers have gone on strike in part to protest working conditions that can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit."
Kentucky,Q3,"In a ruling, a federal judge temporarily blocked the part of the law that would have banned hormone replacement therapy for people under 18. A federal judge in Georgia has temporarily blocked part of a state law that prohibits hormone replacement therapy for transgender minors. The preliminary injunction was issued by Judge Sarah E. Geraghty of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Georgia on Sunday, more than a month after the ban took effect."

Kentucky,Q3,"Lawmakers’ deaths have sometimes helped to flip partisan control. With an aging, narrowly divided Senate, it could be a possibility again. Dianne Feinstein, who died on Thursday at 90, was the first senator to die in office since John McCain in 2018."
Kentucky,Q3,Judge Amul Thapar assiduously defends the Supreme Court justice but says courts should foster greater public understanding of how they work. Judge Amul Thapar thinks America is misjudging its judges — one in particular.
Kentucky,Q3,"Supporters of protecting abortion in the state’s Constitution submitted enough signatures to get on the November ballot. But another vote in August could make it harder to win. Ohio moved one step closer to becoming the next big test case in the nation’s fight over abortion, after supporters of a measure that would ask voters to establish a right to abortion in the state’s Constitution this week said they had filed more than enough signatures to put it on the ballot in November."
Kentucky,Q3,"President Biden went to Asia with a diplomatic to-do list. But he also wanted to show he remains up to the rigors of globe-trotting statesmanship. On the 13th hour of the third day of a two-country trip, President Biden stepped onstage at a news conference in Vietnam and bid reporters there a good evening."
Kentucky,Q3,"States defending transition care bans for minors have had success in the courts recently after a series of early victories for transgender rights advocates. A federal appellate panel said Monday that Alabama’s ban on hormone treatments and puberty blockers for transgender young people could be enforced, the latest in a series of courtroom setbacks for transgender rights advocates."
Kentucky,Q3,"Why does the party seem so blasé about elevating leaders who are oblivious to the views of the young people who stand to inherit it? President Biden’s advanced age (80) gets rehashed endlessly, because the human condition makes it inescapable. A deft politician can wait out almost any other liability: Scandals and gaffes fade over time; the economy bounces back; governing errors can be corrected. But Mr. Biden will never be (or appear) younger than he is today. The problem of his age will never fade."
Kentucky,Q3,"The United Auto Workers union is seeking big raises and other gains in contract talks with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. The United Auto Workers union said on Friday that 97 percent of its members had voted to authorize strikes against General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis if the union and companies were unable to negotiate new labor contracts."
Kentucky,Q3,"Tim Flannery’s rollicking life as an athlete and a musician was nearly cut short by a staph infection. But one of baseball’s most unlikely characters found his way back. Night had fallen, spirits were moving and the songwriting baseball coach was rounding third base and headed for home. Twice in the autumn of 2020, doctors had advised a gravely ill Tim Flannery to say goodbye to his family. Both times, he declined to surrender."
Kentucky,Q3,"The secretary of state’s plea came as Republicans, in a practice once considered beyond the pale, were stalling a wide range of President Biden’s nominees. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called on the Senate to quickly confirm more than three dozen State Department nominees, charging that delaying tactics employed by Republican senators seeking leverage on unrelated issues were “undermining national security.”"
Kentucky,Q3,"The Utah Republican and 2012 G.O.P. presidential nominee, 76, said he would step aside to make way for younger leaders and strongly suggested that the president and former president should, too. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who made a historic break with his party when he voted to remove former President Donald J. Trump from office, announced on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in 2024, saying he wanted to make way for a “new generation of leaders.”"
Kentucky,Q3,"The July 21, 2023, episode of “The Ezra Klein Show.” Every Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation about something that matters, like today’s episode with Barbara Kingsolver. Listen wherever you get your podcasts."
Kentucky,Q3,"For the pro-life movement, persuasion is everything. On Sunday, Donald Trump sent shock waves through the Republican primary when an interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press” aired in which he said that Ron DeSantis did a “terrible thing” and made a “terrible mistake” when he signed Florida’s six-week abortion ban. It’s the kind of statement that could end virtually any other Republican presidential campaign. Opposition to abortion rights, after all, is every bit as fundamental to Republican identity as support for abortion rights is to Democratic identity. Breaking with the party on that issue is the kind of heresy that no national politician can survive."
Kentucky,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated. In the wake of the decision, 15 largely conservative states imposed near-total bans (through trigger laws or new legislation), and two more set limits at six weeks of pregnancy. "
Kentucky,Q3,"The Swiss bank’s sharply discounted takeover of Credit Suisse led to a paper gain that gave it the biggest quarterly profit by a bank in history. When UBS agreed to buy its archrival, Credit Suisse, for a little over $3 billion this spring at the Swiss government’s behest, analysts and investors said that price represented a steep discount. UBS’s latest financial results reflect just how much of a steal it was."
Kentucky,Q3,"We’ve been writing about the fabric of America’s communities, beyond breaking news. As reporters, we go where the news is."
Kentucky,Q3,"An agreement between Senate Republicans and Democrats would keep agencies open through mid-November and provide billions in aid for Ukraine and disaster relief. But House Republicans are likely to balk. Senate Republicans and Democrats reached agreement on Tuesday on a stopgap spending plan that would head off a government shutdown on Sunday while providing billions in disaster relief and aid to Ukraine, but the measure faced resistance in the Republican-led House."
Kentucky,Q3,"The striking actors’ union is granting waivers to some projects not affiliated with the major studios, but questions persist about who qualifies and why. When you’re making an independent film every second counts. Ash Avildsen had six days of filming left on his low-budget biopic “Queen of the Ring” — including a climactic scene involving a majority of his cast — when the actors’ union went on strike on July 14."
Kentucky,Q3,"After a standout college career at the University of Tennessee, she won two Olympic gold medals, played nine years in the W.N.B.A. and was the head coach at two universities. Nikki McCray-Penson, an all-American point guard for the powerhouse University of Tennessee women’s basketball team, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a three-time All-Star in the W.N.B.A., died on Friday. She was 51."
Kentucky,Q3,"In a sign that the pandemic really is over, the total number of Americans dying each day is no longer historically abnormal.

Kentucky,Q3,"A collection of free links to help those participating in our multimedia challenge, “What High School Is Like in 2023.” Education stories have dominated headlines over the past year, as a quick glance down this long, long list will show. "
Kentucky,Q3,"In crafting an anti-abortion message that doesn’t alienate moderate Republicans and swing voters, her approach has won both supporters and detractors. In May 2016, Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina walked down the aisle of the statehouse, beaming and shaking hands, after signing legislation that would largely outlaw abortion in the state after 20 weeks of pregnancy."
Kentucky,Q3,"Dozens of players were caught up in the lies and false promises of Bishop Sycamore and Christians of Faith Academy. One player made it out to play major college football. The University of Louisville football team’s fortunes are unlikely to rise and fall on the squat legs of Mario Agyen, a 5-foot-7, 190-pound, walk-on running back who joined the team in the middle of last season after an end-of-summer tryout."
Kentucky,Q3,"Discover how a distinguished beverage house, marking a century of whisky-making, is leading a mission to preserve life’s most precious resource, water. "
Kentucky,Q3,"Republicans loaded the measure with a raft of social policy provisions — including limits on abortions, gender transition procedures and diversity training — that have little chance of surviving in the Senate. Republicans on Friday rammed through the House a deeply partisan defense bill that would limit abortion access, transgender care and diversity training for military personnel, setting up a showdown with the Senate. The coming fight could imperil the crucial annual measure to provide a pay raise for troops, set defense policy to counter U.S. adversaries and sustain Pentagon programs at a time of rising threats."
Kentucky,Q3,"The Utah Republican’s announcement that he would retire coincided with the publication of a forthcoming book based on extensive interviews in which he slammed his party and the Senate. When Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, announced on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in 2024, it was the culmination of a long estrangement between Mr. Romney and his party."
Kentucky,Q4,"Tyson said it had received complaints from consumers about finding small metal pieces in the product. Federal regulators said one “minor oral injury” had been reported. Tyson Foods is recalling nearly 30,000 pounds of its dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets after some consumers said they found small metal pieces in them, federal officials said."
Kentucky,Q4,"The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on whether to tell young children the truth about Christmas myths. I’m a parent of two small children, the eldest of whom is 2½ years old. Last year at Christmastime, family members and friends began to remark to my eldest about Santa Claus bringing him gifts for the holiday. He seemed too young to understand the idea of Santa, but now as we approach another holiday season and he is one year older, I find myself struggling with the concept."

Kentucky,Q4,The outcome is being closely watched by Democrats and Republicans looking to measure the strength of voter anger over the loss of federal abortion protections. Ohio voters are deciding on a ballot measure that would amend the state’s Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right to abortion.
Kentucky,Q4,"Transgender minors in the state will be able to receive gender transition care for now, while the challenge against the state ban proceeds. A federal judge in Idaho temporarily blocked the enforcement of a state law on Tuesday that bans gender transition care for minors and threatens medical professionals with a felony conviction if they provide such care, just six days before it was set to take effect."
Kentucky,Q4,"Democratic candidates jumped on the story of a woman who left Texas for an abortion as a cautionary tale for voters, and Republicans were largely silent. The case of a Texas woman who sought a court-approved abortion but wound up leaving the state for the procedure is reigniting political arguments that have roiled elections for more than two years, placing Democrats on the offensive and illustrating Republicans’ continued lack of a unified policy response or clear strategy on how to talk about the issue."
Kentucky,Q4,"Despite his bad poll numbers, I see a path to victory for Biden. Well, this week has been an emotional roller coaster. On Sunday, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed President Biden behind Donald Trump in a bunch of battleground states, sending Democrats into a tizzy. Then on Tuesday, voters handed Democrats a string of election victories — the kind they have enjoyed in election after election since Trump was inaugurated in 2017."
Kentucky,Q4,A look at last night’s election results. Yesterday’s elections went well for the Democratic Party.
Kentucky,Q4,"Hours before the ruling, a group representing the woman, whose fetus received a fatal diagnosis, said she was leaving Texas for an abortion. The Texas Supreme Court on Monday overturned a lower court order allowing an abortion for a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, hours after her lawyers said she had decided to leave Texas for the procedure in the face of the state’s abortion bans."
Kentucky,Q4,"A coalition of groups collecting petition signatures for a ballot protecting abortion rights says its fund-raising got a boost after the Ohio results. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, campaigns to protect abortion rights have galvanized voters in state after state. It has become Democrats’ most successful issue ahead of an uncertain 2024 election cycle — and their biggest hope, especially after voters in Ohio approved on Tuesday a measure to enshrine abortion rights in the State Constitution."
Kentucky,Q4,"With post-Roe outrage showing no sign of waning, strategists on the right are pushing a new lexicon on abortion. In the year since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the Republican Party has tested out constantly changing talking points and messages on abortion in an attempt to make its anti-abortion policies sound less extreme. Conservatives are even considering moving away from the term “pro-life,” fearing that voters have newly negative associations with the label."
Kentucky,Q4,"At an annual gathering in Arizona, Democratic governors offered a series of explanations for the president’s political struggles and suggested ideas for selling voters on his re-election. America’s Democratic governors brag about booming local economies, preside over ribbon-cuttings of projects paid for with new federal legislation and have successfully framed themselves as defenders of abortion rights and democracy."
Kentucky,Q4,"A number of skirmishes unfolded in Congress as tempers flared ahead of a government shutdown deadline and Thanksgiving holiday break. The former G.O.P. speaker elbowed one of the Republicans who had voted to oust him. A Republican senator rose to challenge an organized labor leader to a brawl during a hearing. Across the Capitol, the chairman of a different panel compared a member of his committee to a cartoon character."
Kentucky,Q4,"The Justice Department inquiry will focus on “credible allegations” that a number of deaths at two jails resulted from use of force, medical neglect and assaults by inmates. The Justice Department on Thursday opened a far-reaching civil rights investigation of two troubled jails in South Carolina after reports of violent and unhealthy living conditions, failure to treat mentally ill prisoners and the abuse of inmates by guards."
Kentucky,Q4,"By splitting money for Israel’s war effort from aid to Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, Speaker Mike Johnson has put the House on a collision course with the Senate and President Biden. Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to force a stand-alone vote on aid for Israel, peeling off a request from the Biden administration for money from Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, has set up a confrontation between the House and Senate over how to fund U.S. allies during the conflicts."
Kentucky,Q4,"In ruling that a pregnant woman did not qualify for a medical exception to abortion bans, the Texas Supreme Court left doctors without clear guidance on which cases might pass legal muster. Texas doctors, women and lawyers have been asking the state for nearly two years to clarify what is and what is not allowed under strict, overlapping abortion bans. Lawmakers passed a bill this year that makes some exceptions to the bans clearer, but it wasn’t enough to help doctors decide whether they could legally give a Dallas woman, Kate Cox, an abortion."
Kentucky,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage. For 35 years, Angela Jemmott and her five brothers paid premiums on a long-term care insurance policy for their 91-year-old mother. But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."
Kentucky,Q4,"On Wednesday, 20 Americans, all anonymously nominated, were recognized by the MacArthur Foundation with $800,000 fellowships often referred to as the “genius” award. Patrick Makuakane, a hula choreographer in San Francisco, was at the Burning Man festival when he received a text from someone who claimed to be from the MacArthur Foundation and had been trying to reach him. The spotty cell service in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada made Makuakane miss the calls, and he did not understand why he was being contacted."
Kentucky,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Kentucky,Q4,"After losing in statehouses, supporters of transgender rights filed lawsuits in at least 14 states to convince judges that transition care for minors was safe. When the summer started, transgender-rights supporters were riding a courtroom winning streak."
Kentucky,Q4,"As the Biden administration prepares to toughen air quality standards, health benefits are weighed against the cost of compliance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is about to announce new regulations governing soot — the particles that trucks, farms, factories, wildfires, power plants and dusty roads generate. By law, the agency isn’t supposed to consider the impact on polluting industries. In practice, it does — and those industries are warning of dire economic consequences."
Kentucky,Q4,"There’s an infestation in the City of Lights, and fashion folks are not immune. Every late September, when the style mavens descend on Paris for fashion week, they envision enjoying buttery post-show croissants and the occasional pack of Vogue cigarettes savored guilt-free at after-parties. But this season, it’s a bit different: Paris is infested with bedbugs."
Kentucky,Q4,"The state has pioneered a therapeutic market for psychedelic mushrooms. Researchers are watching with a mix of excitement and unease. In a carpeted office suite, Alex Beck settled onto a mattress and, under the watch of a trained guide, began chomping through a handful of “Pumpkin Hillbilly” mushrooms."
Kentucky,Q4,"The help Americans receive after disasters isn’t just inadequate; it’s complicated to navigate and painfully slow to arrive. This summer, 12 people let me into their lives to tell me about their experiences in the aftermath of disasters, including hurricanes, floods, freezes, wildfires and derechos. All said, they did not receive the aid they expected, and the effects have been devastating. “It’s been a very humbling experience, to say the least, to go from ‘We’re fine, we just got a new house, we have a huge savings, biggest we’ve ever had’ to ‘You have nothing and you lost everything and you have to go to food pantries for food,’” said Aleasha LeClere, whose life was turned upside down by a 2020 derecho in Iowa. According to research on disasters and advocacy groups, these survivors’ experiences are very much the norm."
Kentucky,Q4,"Benjamin Netanyahu’s vow to continue the war in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israeli troops fighting in the Gaza Strip yesterday, his second known trip to the territory since the war began. His visit came hours after Gazan health officials reported that a devastating overnight strike on a crowded neighborhood had killed dozens."
Kentucky,Q4,But leaders of both parties cited steady progress on a package tying Ukraine military assistance to tougher border policies and hope for a deal early next month. The Senate quietly closed out its year on Wednesday by punting many of its most difficult issues into 2024. It failed to deliver on aid to Ukraine. It could not agree on a border policy plan. And a government shutdown is on the horizon.
Kentucky,Q4,"We have the tools we need to create a world where addiction is just one aspect of people’s lives instead of a dark portal to despair and early death. Raina Mcmahan, a 42-year-old recovery coach, spent roughly half her life seeking treatment for her own opioid use disorder."
Kentucky,Q4,"The state’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, has a strategy to win the state. If it halts Democrats’ momentum on the issue, it could be a model for the party in 2024. Abortion has been a losing issue at the polls for Republicans across the country since the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. But now in Virginia, which holds elections in early November, the party thinks it has hit upon a formula to stop the electoral drubbings."
Kentucky,Q4,"Post-Roe voting might bring America to a new consensus — but only if the voters keep getting their say. As long as the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, conservatives complained that it had squelched the democratic process — that unelected men in black robes had handed down a national edict rather than letting the American people sort out a consensus."
Kentucky,Q4,"Worried about alienating critical blocs of voters, House Republicans from competitive districts are digging in against using spending bills for abortion and contraception restrictions. Two days after Republicans across the country suffered a drubbing, dragged down by their opposition to abortion rights in the off-year elections, G.O.P. leaders on Capitol Hill appeared not to have gotten the memo."
Kentucky,Q4,"They’re anxious about an uncertain future that is beyond their control. Last week, the actress Felicity Huffman made her first public comments about her role in the Varsity Blues admissions scandal, in which several wealthy parents paid a corrupt private admissions consultant named Rick Singer thousands of dollars to help them cheat to get their children into elite colleges. In 2019, Huffman pleaded guilty to “a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, acknowledging that she paid $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT test.” She spent 11 days in prison, paid a $30,000 fine and had to do community service as part of her sentence."
Kentucky,Q4,"Lawmakers bought time for talks, but heading off another shutdown threat early next year will be difficult. And a separate funding measure for Israel, Ukraine and the border remains unaddressed. The stopgap spending bill Congress sent to President Biden late Wednesday prevented the federal government from shutting down as of 12:01 a.m. Saturday. But it is only a temporary reprieve, and lawmakers have considerable work to do before federal agencies again face the threat of running out of money beginning Jan. 19."
Kentucky,Q4,The State Constitution will protect access to the procedure. The ballot result sends a strong signal that voters are still angry about the demise of Roe. Ohio’s resounding approval of a ballot measure enshrining a right to abortion in the State Constitution continued a winning streak for abortion-rights groups that have appealed directly to voters after the demise of Roe v. Wade.
Kentucky,Q4,"If childhood obesity is an ‘epidemic,’ how far should doctors go to treat it? Last fall, Alexandra Duarte, who is now 16, went to see her endocrinologist at Texas Children’s Hospital, outside Houston. From age 10, she had been living with polycystic ovary syndrome and, more recently, prediabetes. After Alexandra described her recent quinceañera, the doctor brought up an operation that might benefit her, one that might help her lose weight and, as a result, improve these obesity-related problems."
Kentucky,Q4,How else are we going to resolve the questions that hang over our democracy? Joe Biden versus Donald Trump is not the choice America wants. But it is the choice we need to face.
Kentucky,Q4,"The United Automobile Workers reported improved wage offers from the automakers and a concession from General Motors on workers at battery factories. The United Automobile Workers union said on Friday that it had made progress in its negotiations with Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, and would not expand the strikes against the companies that began three weeks ago."
Kentucky,Q4,"More tenants than ever spend half or more of their income for shelter, leaving less for everything else, taking an emotional toll and leaving some without a place to call their own. To understand how rising rents punish families of modest means, look no further than the queen-size bed that Jessica Jones and her three children share in her mother’s living room, where each night brings a squirming, turning tussle for space in a house with no privacy."
Kentucky,Q4,"Can a Democrat win the Deep South? And other questions to help you make sense of the results. Today is Election Day, and we are using this newsletter to give you a guide. One theme is that Democrats are hoping to continue their strong recent electoral performance despite President Biden’s low approval rating."
Kentucky,Q4,"Schools run by the Defense Department educate 66,000 children of civilian employees and service members. Improving America’s schools can sometimes seem like an impossible task. Politicians have been promising to do so for decades, yet the U.S. remains well behind many other countries in basic measures of learning. The Covid pandemic, with its extended school closures, aggravated the problems."
Kentucky,Q4,"Also, the F.D.A. approved a new obesity drug. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. Abortion rights and marijuana legalization prevailed in Ohio. Democrats held the governor’s mansion in Kentucky, took full control of the General Assembly in Virginia and won a Supreme Court election in Pennsylvania. They were even competitive in Mississippi."
Kentucky,Q4,"Also, the Supreme Court suggested it would uphold a gun restriction. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Today is Election Day in many U.S. states. And even though we’re in what political analysts call an off-year — with neither a presidential election nor midterm congressional elections — a steady stream of voters still showed up at polling stations."
Kentucky,Q4,"Some lawmakers are likely to oppose the move, but officials said the Biden administration has noted the kingdom’s de facto cease-fire with the Houthi militia in Yemen. The Biden administration is preparing to relax restrictions on some weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials said on Thursday, crediting the kingdom’s peace talks with a militia in Yemen for hastening an easing of the constraints."
Kentucky,Q4,"Dentists and lactation consultants around the country are pushing “tongue-tie releases” on new mothers struggling to breastfeed. Tess Merrell had breastfed three babies and never expected trouble with her fourth. But after a month of struggling with her newborn, she hired Melanie Henstrom for help."
Kentucky,Q4,"At the Becoming an Outdoors Woman workshop, no one feels uncomfortable discussing the ick factor of live fishing bait. With some tweaks, the colorful minnow and feathered lures would make pretty cute earrings, I thought, or great Christmas tree ornaments."
Kentucky,Q4,"The minority leader, who many believe could step down next year, has found himself out of step with many fellow Senate Republicans on the question of keeping money flowing to the U.S. ally. Senator Mitch McConnell, the longtime Republican leader, has been outspoken over the past year about challenging the isolationist wing of his party that was questioning continued aid to Ukraine. He put his influence and reputation on the line to make the case that it was in the United States’ interest to help a beleaguered democracy trying to beat a Russian invasion led by Vladimir V. Putin, and expressed confidence that his party would join him."
Kentucky,Q4,"A Republican leadership vacuum has allowed the former president to exert power over his party — and in the country — in a way that lacks much historical precedent. From a House leadership contest to the southwestern border and a foreign war, Donald J. Trump’s influence this week seemed to pervade the nation’s politics more than it has since the first weeks after his exit from the White House."
Kentucky,Q4,"His political journal challenged liberal and conservative orthodoxies for decades. Charles Peters, the founding editor of The Washington Monthly, a small political journal that challenged liberal and conservative orthodoxies and for decades was avidly read in the White House, Congress and the city’s newsrooms, died on Thursday at his home in Washington. He was 96."
Kentucky,Q4,"Also, Biden and Netanyahu disagree over the war’s next steps. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, trudged across Washington today, making urgent pleas for quick approval of more aid for his country’s war against Russia. But in the meetings that mattered most — with Republican leaders whose allies hold the decisive votes — Zelensky’s pitch appeared to hit a brick wall."
Kentucky,Q4,"The United Automobile Workers on Tuesday expanded its strike to General Motors’ largest U.S. plant a day after striking at a Ram truck plant. The United Automobile Workers union shut down production at General Motors’ largest U.S. factory on Tuesday, significantly stepping up pressure on the large U.S. automakers as signs multiplied that the six-week strike is taking a toll on profits."
Kentucky,Q4,"President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are set to meet on Wednesday, as the two seek to maintain ties despite trade tensions. Nine months after the Chinese spy balloon controversy sent relations between Washington and Beijing to a new low, President Biden and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will meet this week in San Francisco for face-to-face talks."
Louisiana,Q1,"Genetic research from China suggests to some experts that the coronavirus may have sprung from a seafood market in Wuhan. Now the data are missing from a scientific database. The World Health Organization rebuked Chinese officials on Friday for withholding research that may link Covid’s origin to wild animals, asking why the data had not been made available three years ago and why it is now missing.Before the Chinese data disappeared, an international team of virus experts downloaded and began analyzing the research, which appeared online in January. They say it supports the idea that the pandemic could have begun when illegally traded raccoon dogs infected humans at a Wuhan seafood market."
Louisiana,Q1,"Citing costs, many hospitals are closing labor and delivery wards, expanding so-called maternity care deserts. TOPPENISH, Wash. — Three days before Christmas, the only hospital in this remote city on the Yakama Indian Reservation abruptly closed its maternity unit without consulting the community, the doctors who delivered babies there or even its own board."
Louisiana,Q1,"‌The first comprehensive data on prison fatalities in the Covid era sheds new light on where and why prisoners were especially vulnerable. Deaths in state and federal prisons across America rose nearly 50 percent during the first year of the pandemic, and in six states they more than doubled, according to the first comprehensive data on prison fatalities in the era of Covid-19."
Louisiana,Q1,The bills would tighten the current 15-week limit and offer narrow exceptions. Gov. Ron DeSantis said he welcomed “pro-life legislation.” Florida Republicans introduced parallel bills on Tuesday in the House and Senate that would further restrict the state’s abortion ban to six from 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Louisiana,Q1,"Najee Seabrooks, 31, was shot and killed by police officers in Paterson, N.J., after calling 911 to report he was experiencing a mental health crisis. The morning he was shot dead, Najee Seabrooks had contacted two groups to report that he was suffering from a mental health crisis: the police and his friends at the Paterson Healing Collective, an anti-violence organization where he worked as a counselor."
Louisiana,Q1,"Experts explain what to watch out for — and what to do — if you’re concerned about a loved one. New data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that, in 2021, suicide rates rose for the first time in two years, with the greatest increases among adolescents and Black and Native Americans. Over the past decade, suicide rates have risen by nearly 15 percent."
Louisiana,Q1,"Ahead of a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, administration officials demanded that Republicans commit to avoiding a default on federal debt. WASHINGTON — President Biden will ask Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, on Wednesday for details on what budget cuts his party is demanding in order to raise the federal debt limit and for assurances that Mr. McCarthy will not accept an economically debilitating government default, White House officials said."
Louisiana,Q1,"In her youth, Blue was a standout mine-hunter for the U.S. military. She and her colleagues are now at the vanguard of geriatric marine mammal medicine. SAN DIEGO — White caps were breaking in the bay and the rain was blowing sideways, but at Naval Base Point Loma, an elderly bottlenose dolphin named Blue was absolutely not acting her age. In a bay full of dolphins, she was impossible to miss, leaping from the water and whistling as a team of veterinarians approached along the floating docks."
Louisiana,Q1,"Sexually explicit content has become so prevalent online that teenagers are deluged, according to a new report by a nonprofit child advocacy group. The internet has transformed pornography, making it much easier to view and share than in the days of Playboy magazine and late-night cable television."
Louisiana,Q1,"Formed last year, the Weather Data team is harnessing clouds of information to share a more comprehensive forecast with readers. In early November, Judson Jones was checking the weather forecast when he noticed that a low-pressure system in the Atlantic Ocean was taking on the characteristic rotation of a tropical cyclone. A hurricane in November is rare, but Mr. Jones could read the signs: A powerful storm was forming. After all, as a meteorologist at The New York Times, it’s what he was hired to do."
Louisiana,Q1,"He was beloved by New York fans for his willingness to play hurt, as memorably exemplified in the decisive Game 7 of the 1970 N.B.A. finals at Madison Square Garden. Willis Reed, the brawny and inspirational hub of two Knicks championship teams that captivated New York in the early 1970s with a canny, team-oriented style of play, died on Tuesday. He was 80."
Louisiana,Q1,"Soak up Mardi Gras season while dive-bar hopping, dancing to brass bands and exploring history in the French Quarter. Soak up Mardi Gras season while dive-bar hopping, dancing to brass bands and exploring history in the French Quarter."
Louisiana,Q1,"Many of the legal arguments seeking to overturn abortion bans rely on rights provided by the states, and how they are interpreted by state supreme courts. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in June, it declared that it was sending the issue back to the “people and their elected representatives.” But the fight has largely moved to a different set of supreme courts and constitutions: those in the states."
Louisiana,Q1,"The first-term Democrat, who was released Friday after two days in the hospital, is coping with the lasting effects of a near-fatal stroke last year, and Congress is adapting to accommodate him. WASHINGTON — At Senator John Fetterman’s desk in the Senate chamber, there is a newly installed monitor that rises or lowers, depending on whether he sits or stands, and provides closed captioning so he can follow the proceedings. At the center dais, a custom desk stand has been built to accommodate the same technology for when he takes his shifts presiding over the Senate."
Louisiana,Q1,"The economy added 311,000 jobs in February despite higher interest rates. But hourly earnings rose more slowly as the pool of available workers grew. The labor market continued its energetic expansion in February, extending a hotter-than-expected streak that has created abundant job opportunities while frustrating the Federal Reserve in its drive to contain stubborn inflation."
Louisiana,Q1,A lawsuit is challenging the F.D.A.’s approval of medication abortion. Data shows the consequences could be far-reaching. A lawsuit is challenging the F.D.A.’s approval of medication abortion. Data shows the consequences could be far-reaching.
Louisiana,Q1,"Not straying far from the zoo but not going back either, a bird of prey on the loose faces serious challenges to survival. At around 10:30 Thursday morning, a half-dozen young women from Australia climbed a large rock outcropping near Central Park’s south end and began to snap pictures of one another with the skyscrapers of Billionaires’ Row as their backdrop."
Louisiana,Q1,"The review, undertaken after a specialized unit killed Breonna Taylor in a botched raid in 2020, paints a damning portrait of a department in crisis. WASHINGTON — The police department in Louisville, Ky., engaged in a far-ranging pattern of discriminatory and abusive law enforcement practices, the Justice Department said on Wednesday after conducting a two-year investigation prompted by the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor by the police in 2020."
Louisiana,Q1,"The House, back in Republican hands, is invoking its powers to weigh in on D.C. legislation, including an overhaul of the city’s century-old criminal code. WASHINGTON — After a heady few years for the District of Columbia’s longtime aspirations of self-governance, with a statehood bill even passing in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2021, the temperature between Congress and the city it sits in has plummeted to new lows."
Louisiana,Q1,"Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, played a pivotal role in negotiating economic legislation the president signed in his first two years in office. WASHINGTON — Brian Deese, who served as President Biden’s top economic adviser and helped create and negotiate the sweeping economic legislation that Mr. Biden signed into law in his first two years in office, will leave his position in mid-February."
Louisiana,Q1,"Genetic samples from the market were recently uploaded to an international database and then removed after scientists asked China about them. An international team of virus experts said on Thursday that they had found genetic data from a market in Wuhan, China, linking the coronavirus with raccoon dogs for sale there, adding evidence to the case that the worst pandemic in a century could have been ignited by an infected animal that was being dealt through the illegal wildlife trade."
Louisiana,Q1,"The Judiciary Committee, responding to the bungled sale of Taylor Swift concert tickets, heard the company apologize and its critics trace the problem to the industry’s lack of competition. Live Nation Entertainment, the concert industry giant that owns Ticketmaster, came under withering attack during a Senate Judiciary hearing on Tuesday, with committee members from both parties criticizing it for the botched sale of tickets to Taylor Swift’s latest tour and calling the company a monopoly that hinders competition and harms consumers."
Louisiana,Q1,"In cities like Detroit and Philadelphia, markets have become year-round destinations, offering classes, crafts and music, as well as a surprising array of fresh produce. On a recent Saturday morning at Eastern Market in Detroit, busking musicians filled the air with jazz as vendors finished setting up for the day’s traffic. Shoppers streamed in, sizing up winter produce, relishes and chutneys, fresh cuts of beef and more."
Louisiana,Q1,"To break the paralysis, focus less on guns and more on those firing them. Oct. 26, 2023: This essay has been updated to reflect news developments."
Louisiana,Q1,"The president has met Republican demands for debt reduction with a plan to trim deficits by taxing companies and the rich.  Months after losing control of the House in 2010, President Barack Obama and his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., released a budget proposal that bowed to Republican warnings about the need to rein in spending by promising a freeze in popular programs like education."
Louisiana,Q1,"A Supreme Court decision overturning century-old New York gun regulations has produced scores of new lawsuits as jurists and citizens sort out what’s legal. Matthew Seifer, a Long Island firearms safety instructor, is licensed by New York State to teach his students where they can legally carry their guns. It’s harder than it sounds."
Louisiana,Q1,"The annual anti-abortion gathering to protest Roe v. Wade is the first since the Supreme Court overturned the right to abortion. WASHINGTON — Thousands of anti-abortion activists convened on the National Mall on Friday for the March for Life, the rally held every January since 1974 to protest Roe v. Wade."
Louisiana,Q1,"A renewed focus on fiscal restraint in the standoff with Democrats poses its own political risks. WASHINGTON — At a news conference this month to showcase how Republicans will handle their looming debt ceiling showdown with Democrats, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin was asked to explain what specific spending cuts his party would support in exchange for lifting the borrowing cap."
Louisiana,Q1,"William Wildman and Parker Kennedy began dating as students at the University of Mississippi before going their separate ways for four years. When William Edwin Wildman III first saw Parker Calin Kennedy in March 2015 at the pool in the condominium complex where they both lived in Oxford, Miss., Mr. Kennedy was drinking a bottle of Veuve Clicquot Champagne with friends."
Louisiana,Q1,"The stunning demise of Silicon Valley Bank has spurred soul-searching about how large and regional banks are overseen. The Federal Reserve is facing criticism over Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, with lawmakers and financial regulation experts asking why the regulator failed to catch and stop seemingly obvious risks. That concern is galvanizing a review of how the central bank oversees financial institutions — one that could end in stricter rules for a range of banks."
Louisiana,Q1,"No. 15 Princeton toppled Arizona, a No. 2 seed that was one of the favorites in the field, while No. 13 seed Furman knocked down No. 4 Virginia. SACRAMENTO — Nearly three decades after one of the most stunning upsets in N.C.A.A. history, the Princeton Tigers delivered another with a shocking 59-55 victory over second-seeded Arizona on Thursday."

Louisiana,Q2,"“The 272,” by Rachel L. Swarns, recounts the decision by the university’s early leaders to sell nearly 300 people enslaved on Jesuit-owned plantations in Maryland in 1838. During the War of 1812, a large extended family of Mahoneys lived and labored as enslaved people on several plantations in southern Maryland. They were descendants of a Black woman named Ann Joice, who had arrived from England in approximately 1676 as an indentured servant. For years she served one of Maryland’s richest men, Charles Calvert, as a domestic in his manor house. In 1684 she was transferred to Calvert’s cousin Henry Darnall, a wealthy Catholic, who promptly burned her indenture papers, rendering her a slave for life."
Louisiana,Q2,"With the procedure now prohibited in many states, the city is advertising its abortion services in Georgia, Texas and Florida. When Nancy Davis of Baton Rouge, La., learned last summer that the fetus she was carrying had a rare and fatal condition, her anguish was compounded by the chaotic legal terrain surrounding the abortion ban in her state. A local abortion clinic had shut down, and her hospital refused to perform the procedure, despite an exception in Louisiana law for pregnancies deemed “medically futile.”"
Louisiana,Q2,"Institutions around the United States are offering more interactive learning to a broader age group, including practices that address mental health. Connor Carey, 15, a sophomore at Fort Lauderdale High School in Florida, has a reading disability known as dyslexia. When he started as an Everglades EcoExplorers intern last summer, he said, he didn’t have a lot of self-confidence or social skills. A job with the Museum of Discovery and Science, a children’s institution in downtown Fort Lauderdale, gave him the opportunity to gain both."
Louisiana,Q2,"The county is hardly the only place in America plagued with sanitation problems. For generations, the residents of Lowndes County, Ala. — a rural, mostly Black community bordering Montgomery — have lacked access to adequate sanitation. Many people funnel the sewage from their homes directly into their backyards, where it pools atop the dense, clay-like soil. The area has seen a resurgence of hookworm, which thrives in areas with poor sanitation. The parasite can drain people of their energy and impair cognitive development in children."
Louisiana,Q2,"A record-breaking heat wave is expected to worsen through the weekend as it spreads through nearby states. A weather pattern that has brought unrelenting heat to Texas for more than a week is unlikely to end until at least early July, according to forecast models, with record-breaking heat expected to expand into nearby states this weekend."
Louisiana,Q2,An outspoken Democrat (and Elvis’s second cousin) makes a strong case to end the state’s culture of corruption and improve the health of its citizens. It’s been 23 years since a Democrat was elected governor of Mississippi and 41 years since a Democrat was elected one of the state’s U.S. senators. The Republican lock on the state — along with the policies and noxious traditions that have kept it in the basement among U.S. states for most indicators of social health — sometimes seems impenetrable.
Louisiana,Q2,"A lifelong protester, he became a leading promoter of organic food and a forceful critic of a food industry that genetically engineers what it produces and sells. Ronnie Cummins, a ponytailed activist who became one of the country’s leading advocates for organic food and a leading critic of genetically modified food, died on April 26 in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where he lived and worked part-time. He was 76."
Louisiana,Q2,"Negotiators have focused on a relatively small corner of the budget, shunning new revenues or cuts to the fastest-growing programs As their debt limit negotiations with President Biden push the nation perilously close to a devastating default, House Republicans have stuck to a clear message: They must force a change in what they call the nation’s “unsustainable” spending path."
Louisiana,Q2,"G.O.P. politicians today aren’t constitutional absolutists. They’re constitutional opportunists. Before the dust had cleared on the 2020 election, Republicans in statehouses across the country had already regrouped and coalesced around a core crusade — revived and revitalized — that was anti-woke and anti-vote."
Louisiana,Q2,"Business groups are critical of the candidate, Julie Su, and key senators are wavering. The administration’s labor policies are central to the clash. Just over a year ago, the White House suffered an embarrassing defeat when three Democratic senators voted against advancing President Biden’s pick to run a key labor agency, dealing a blow to the administration’s pro-labor agenda."
Louisiana,Q2,"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has long been at the center of high-profile challenges, and a wave of Trump appointees has pushed it to the leading edge of potent policy decisions. The latest battle over a widely used abortion drug is set to play out on Wednesday before a conservative appeals court in New Orleans that has become the testing ground for some of the most contentious policy fights in the nation."
Louisiana,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Louisiana,Q2,"The ruling in Richmond is one of the first successful challenges to gun control laws under the Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 Bruen decision. A judge in Virginia has struck down federal laws blocking handgun sales to buyers over 18 and under 21, in a ruling that might augur the rollback of regulation prompted by the Supreme Court’s sweeping expansion of gun rights last year."
Louisiana,Q2,"In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities. In the year since Roe was struck down, clinic owners have scrambled to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion. Here’s what happened to them, and their communities."
Louisiana,Q2,"Summer technically just began, and parts of the U.S. already have dangerous heat. Today, New Orleans will reach 113 degrees in the heat index. Houston will reach 111. Mobile, Ala., and Jackson, Miss., will also surpass 110. And those are only a few of the places that will experience dangerous heat this week."
Louisiana,Q2,"The city said it would try to negotiate a court-enforced consent decree with the federal government that would require an overhaul of its police force. The Justice Department said on Friday that the Minneapolis police routinely discriminated against Black and Native American people, used deadly force without justification and trampled the First Amendment rights of protesters and journalists — damning findings that grew out of a multiyear investigation and may lead to a court-enforced overhaul. "
Louisiana,Q2,"The prohibition is among the most restrictive in the country, and Florida will no longer be a destination for women from across the Deep South seeking the procedure. MIAMI — Florida lawmakers voted to prohibit abortions after six weeks of pregnancy on Thursday, culminating a rapid effort by elected Republicans and Gov. Ron DeSantis to transform the state to one of the most restrictive in the country."
Louisiana,Q2,"The negotiations at the White House came a day after the Treasury Department said the government could run out of money to pay its bills by June 1. President Biden and congressional leaders in both parties emerged from a White House meeting on Tuesday offering glimmers of hope about eventually reaching a deal to raise the nation’s borrowing limit, even as they conceded they were still far from averting a default that could come as soon as June 1."
Louisiana,Q2,"Lab safety failures have been a continual danger, with too little being done. In December 2014, two monkeys in outdoor cages at the Tulane National Primate Research Center, about 40 miles north of New Orleans, became ill with Burkholderia pseudomallei, a deadly bacterium in the federal government’s highest risk category, reserved for pathogens like smallpox, anthrax and Ebola. This is the category for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sees “significant potential for mass casualties or severe effects.”"
Louisiana,Q2,"Also, the Wagner chief begins exile in Belarus. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Justices on the country’s highest court rejected a legal theory that would have radically reshaped how elections are conducted by giving state legislatures largely unchecked power to set rules for federal elections and to draw congressional maps warped by partisan gerrymandering. The 6-to-3 decision was cheered by voting rights advocates who feared an undemocratic fallout if the Supreme Court had ruled the other way."
Louisiana,Q2,"The strategy, which was used in 2011, could allow both sides to save face but would most likely do little to chip away at the national debt. As negotiators for the White House and House Republican leaders struggle to reach a deal over how to raise the nation’s debt limit, a solution that harks back to old budget fights has re-emerged as a potential path forward: spending caps."
Louisiana,Q2,"The bank had not fixed its problems before it failed, they said. Its leader was not excluded from the sale process. When asked in a Senate hearing this week who was to blame for the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, the lender’s former chief executive, Greg Becker, had plenty of ideas, blaming regulators, the bank’s board and its own customers for bringing it down."
Louisiana,Q2,"Richard Revesz is changing the way the government calculates the cost and benefits of regulation, with far-reaching implications for climate change. This spring the Biden administration proposed or implemented eight major environmental regulations, including the nation’s toughest climate rule, rolling out what experts say are the most ambitious limits on polluting industries by the government in a single season."
Louisiana,Q2,"New York does not require bystanders to act when someone is in danger, but the killing on the F train has residents debating when they should step in. As Jordan Neely struggled to free himself from a chokehold in the New York City subway earlier this month, there were the passengers who pinned him down and the passengers who watched."
Louisiana,Q2,"The May 19, 2023, episode of “The Ezra Klein Show.” Every Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation about something that matters, like today’s episode with Jean Twenge. Listen wherever you get your podcasts."
Louisiana,Q2,"With right-wing Republicans all but certain to oppose any bipartisan compromise, the speaker has a narrow path to push one through the closely divided House. Speaker Kevin McCarthy is attempting a difficult balancing act as he tries to extract spending concessions from President Biden in exchange for raising the debt ceiling: cobbling together a deal that can win the votes of a majority of Republicans without alienating the critical mass of Democrats he would need to push it through the House."
Louisiana,Q2,"Extreme heat is increasing electricity demand as people crank up the AC. The strain could be too much. It’s really hot in Texas right now. Many parts of the state are hotter than they’ve ever been at this time of year. In the coastal city of Corpus Christi, the heat index, a combined measure of heat and humidity, reached a shocking 125 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 52 Celsius."
Louisiana,Q2,"A federal judge in Washington State issued a ruling ordering the Food and Drug Administration to make no changes to the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone on Friday, directly contradicting another judge’s ruling in a legal standoff likely to escalate to the Supreme Court.

Louisiana,Q2,"Around the world, tens of millions could lose their homes in the coming decades. Planning is the key to protecting them. What does a country do when rising seas threaten to swamp its coastal capital?"
Louisiana,Q2,"They rarely give on-the-record interviews. Only two are on Twitter. But they will be the main force behind the president’s political strategy. When President Biden announced his re-election campaign and its top two staff members this week, the names of his closest and longest-serving advisers were not included."
Louisiana,Q2,"The 31-year-old singer and songwriter is releasing a self-titled album on a major label — and bracing for the potential backlash. “I’m terrified,” Lauren Daigle said with a broad smile rather than any evident terror. It was six weeks before the release of her new self-titled album, and the biggest singer in contemporary Christian music (CCM) was sitting in a lounge at the midtown Manhattan offices of Atlantic Records, glowing with positivity."
Louisiana,Q2,"The Republican-led chamber moved to refer articles of impeachment to two House committees, charging that the president’s immigration policies are an impeachable offense. The Republican-led House on Thursday quashed a move to quickly impeach President Biden but voted along party lines to open an investigation into his removal, as reluctant G.O.P. leaders bowed to a member of their hard-right flank who demanded to move forward with charges that his immigration policies constitute high crimes and misdemeanors."
Louisiana,Q2,"Buoyed by a $2.3 million grant, the archive hopes increased visibility on the first-person accounts of incarcerated people can serve as a road map for policy reforms. At an age when his peers were getting driver’s licenses and thinking about college, Jose Di Lenola, then 17, was behind bars in one of New York State’s most violent prisons, earning “a master’s degree in Prison Survival,” as he put it. He learned how to wield a metal can lid as a weapon and fashion a protective vest out of magazine covers taped to his torso."
Louisiana,Q2,"With single-party statehouse control at its highest level in decades, legislators across much of the country leaned into cultural issues and bulldozed the opposition. America’s state capitals are as polarized as they have been in decades, with lawmakers imposing unflinchingly conservative or liberal agendas this year, even in politically diverse places."
Louisiana,Q2,"The battle for a state Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a microcosm of the country. It is narrowly divided politically, though Democrats have a slight advantage in the popular vote in statewide elections. And, as in Washington, Republicans have structural advantages in the government that give them outsize power."
Louisiana,Q2,"Federal law has put thousands of women on anti-addiction medications into an impossible bind: Give up your treatment or risk losing your baby. One morning in the summer of 2020, Jade Dass woke up and vomited. She assumed she was hung over; she’d been depressed lately and sometimes self-medicated with too much wine. But then a woman in her online counseling group suggested that she might be pregnant. Dass looked in the mirror and realized she was probably right."
Louisiana,Q2,"As more states legalize marijuana and competition for talent grows fiercer, the U.S. government is loosening guidelines from the “Just Say No” era. Not long ago, urinating in a cup for a drug test was a widely accepted, if annoying, requirement to start a new job. The legalization of marijuana in more and more states in recent years upended that, prompting many employers to shelve hiring rules from the “Just Say No” era."
Louisiana,Q2,"The regional lender said it is weighing its options, after its shares fell despite assertions by the Federal Reserve that the recent bank crisis is contained. The regional banking sector is teetering again, with PacWest’s stock plummeting more than 35 percent in premarket trading, despite the Fed chair Jay Powell’s assessment that the worst is over."
Louisiana,Q2,"A federal judge in Texas issued a preliminary ruling invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s 23-year-old approval of the abortion pill mifepristone on Friday, clashing with another court’s ruling in a legal standoff likely to escalate to the Supreme Court.

Louisiana,Q2,"What the Arizona senator’s breakup with the Democrats means for American politics. Kyrsten Sinema was standing a few yards from the border wall with four Republican members of Congress. The men were staring balefully at a row of nearby portable toilets, wondering aloud if they could hold out for a proper bathroom on the way back to the airport. Sinema assured Representatives David Valadao of California and Tony Gonzales of Texas that they need not worry on her account."
Louisiana,Q2,"The Supreme Court ruled that the race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina were unlawful, curtailing affirmative action at colleges and universities around the nation.

Louisiana,Q2,The energy industry is undergoing a huge transformation. Sustainability goals and the demand for a cleaner energy system are driving new investment across the entire sector. So what strategies can organizations use to navigate the energy transition? Episode Transcription
Louisiana,Q3,"As states and counties spend the first wave of billions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry, public health groups are challenging how some funds are being used. After years of litigation to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for the deadly abuse of prescription painkillers, payments from what could amount to more than $50 billion in court settlements have started to flow to states and communities to address the nation’s continuing opioid crisis."
Louisiana,Q3,"A selection of recently published books. DOWN WITH THE POOR!, by Shumona Sinha. Translated by Teresa Lavender Fagan. (Deep Vellum, paperback, $16.95.) After a Bengali interpreter who works with asylum seekers in Paris is charged with assaulting a refugee, her resulting self-examination lays bare the callousness of France’s asylum system."
Louisiana,Q3,"Still, there are fewer than 200 cases nationally each year, and the numbers have fallen significantly from the peak decades ago. Leprosy, a fearsome scourge of ancient civilizations, may have become a permanent fixture in Florida, according to a new study."
Louisiana,Q3,"The ruling sought to clarify the medical exceptions in the state’s bans, and was in a response to a lawsuit from women who were denied abortions despite medical emergencies. A Texas judge ruled on Friday that the state must allow doctors to provide abortions to pregnant women whose health or lives are in danger, or whose fetuses have little likelihood of survival."
Louisiana,Q3,"They said a restriction on government interaction with social media companies could impede efforts to curb false claims about vaccines and voter fraud. A federal judge’s decision this week to restrict the government’s communication with social media platforms could have broad side effects, according to researchers and groups that combat hate speech, online abuse and disinformation: It could further hamper efforts to curb harmful content."
Louisiana,Q3,"So far, 24 states have eliminated sales taxes on period products that have been criticized as discriminatory. On Friday, a bipartisan Texas bill that eliminates sales taxes on menstrual products went into effect, making it the 24th state in the country, as well as District of Columbia, to remove what is colloquially known as the “tampon tax.”"
Louisiana,Q3,"A Fifth Circuit panel partly upheld restrictions on the Biden administration’s communications with online platforms about their content. A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that the Biden administration most likely overstepped the First Amendment by urging the major social media platforms to remove misleading or false content about the Covid-19 pandemic, partly upholding a lower court’s preliminary injunction in a victory for conservatives."
Louisiana,Q3,"Extreme heat killed 10 people in Laredo, a sign that the eventual death toll from this year’s widespread heat waves could be substantial. Alfredo Garza Jr. died in his bedroom with two broken air-conditioners, on a downtown street in Laredo, Texas, across from a coffee shop and a bakery. When his body was found, the temperature inside the room was 106 degrees."
Louisiana,Q3,"After Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, some feared that other court rulings, including the 2003 decision that invalidated sodomy laws, could be revisited. Maryland and Minnesota recently repealed theirs. It has been 20 years since the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws with its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, but legal codes inherited from colonial laws and used to prosecute L.G.B.T.Q. people by banning some sexual acts remain in place across the country."
Louisiana,Q3,"The Louisiana Republican said he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, but would return to Washington to continue working as he undergoes treatment. Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana and the majority leader, said Tuesday he had been diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer but planned to return to Washington to continue working as he undergoes treatment over the next several months."
Louisiana,Q3,"Mr. Kennedy, the proposed nominee for health secretary, has for decades promoted baseless conspiracy theories. He has promoted a conspiracy theory that coronavirus vaccines were developed to control people via microchips. He has endorsed the false notion that antidepressants are linked to school shootings. And he has pushed the decades-old idea that the C.I.A. killed his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy."
Louisiana,Q3,"Government cannot deputize the private sector to act as a censor. In the late 1950s, the Rhode Island legislature created a commission “to encourage morality in youth.” One of its practices was to send notices to out-of-state distributors and retailers of publications it deemed obscene, asking for “cooperation” in suppressing them. The notices warned that the commission had circulated lists of objectionable materials to local police departments, and that it would recommend prosecution against those found to be purveying obscenity."
Louisiana,Q3,"This is the striking historical backdrop for Fani Willis’s indictment of Donald Trump. With her sweeping indictment of former President Donald Trump and over a dozen co-conspirators, the Fulton County, Ga., district attorney, Fani Willis, is now set to prosecute her case in a court of law. Just as important, it is essential that she and others continue to explain to the American public why the decision serves a critical purpose beyond the courts and for the health of our constitutional order."
Louisiana,Q3,"Age verification laws are changing websites for both children and adults. Like millions of other teenagers, Jack Merrill, an 18-year-old living outside of Chicago, regularly uses the online game platform Roblox. So when it rolled out a new feature — voice chatting with other users — he wanted to try it. But first, he had to pull out his driver’s license."
Louisiana,Q3,"A wave of extreme heat has posed particular perils for older people, who are uniquely susceptible to such conditions. When the torrential rain stopped on Friday afternoon, Laura Lowry could see the steam rising off the wet pavement. She was on her front porch in the Fifth Ward neighborhood of Houston, desperate for relief from the relentless humidity and 91-degree heat. The air-conditioner in her house worked, but she and her husband, reliant on disability checks, couldn’t afford to run it."
Louisiana,Q3,"With punishing temperatures across many states, restaurants are adapting to a new climate reality. Around midday on Wednesday, as the heat index reached more than 102 degrees in Baton Rouge, La., Tremaine Devine was searing burgers on the grill inside his food truck when he began to turn pale and felt lightheaded and short of breath."
Louisiana,Q3,"In its monthly call, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration analyzed how June’s temperatures stacked up and said it expects August to continue the trend. Last month was the planet’s warmest June since global temperature record-keeping began in 1850, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its monthly climate update on Thursday. The agency also predicts unusually hot temperatures will occur in most of the United States, almost everywhere except the northern Great Plains, during August."
Louisiana,Q3,"The case, which could alter how the government battles disinformation, is a flashpoint in a broader effort by conservatives to document what they contend is a liberal conspiracy to silence their views. Two months after President Biden took office, his top digital adviser emailed officials at Facebook urging them to do more to limit the spread of “vaccine hesitancy” on the social media platform."
Louisiana,Q3,"Parents and public health experts have a lot to say about what adolescent girls do on their phones. We asked teens to weigh in. Psychologists suggest teenagers take social media breaks, and ask themselves as they scroll: “Do I feel bad about myself while looking at this?” Public health experts recommend “adult monitoring” and setting clear boundaries for when and where teens have access to their phones. The surgeon general wants parents to keep their child’s bedroom device-free for at least an hour before bedtime, and through the night. In Utah, lawmakers have determined that kids under 18 should not have access to TikTok or Instagram without parental permission."
Louisiana,Q3,"The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water. The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water."
Louisiana,Q3,"Do we own our bodies? The answer, according to many legal experts, is no. Do we own our bodies? To an ordinary person, the answer is obviously yes. To a lawyer, it’s not at all clear. That discrepancy needs to be resolved."
Louisiana,Q3,"President Biden went to Asia with a diplomatic to-do list. But he also wanted to show he remains up to the rigors of globe-trotting statesmanship. On the 13th hour of the third day of a two-country trip, President Biden stepped onstage at a news conference in Vietnam and bid reporters there a good evening."
Louisiana,Q3,"“It drains your brain. It slows your cognitive function. You’re overwhelmed.” Linda Ressler is an airplane cabin cleaner at the airport in Phoenix, where the temperature has reached or surpassed 110 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 days in a row and counting."
Louisiana,Q3,A Supreme Court decision created a 50-state patchwork of differing abortion laws. An eclectic network of volunteers and organizations has tried to fill the gaps in health care and support. A Supreme Court decision created a 50-state patchwork of differing abortion laws. An eclectic network of volunteers and organizations has tried to fill the gaps in health care and support.
Louisiana,Q3,"American women are seeking help from Mexico for abortions, crystallizing the shifting policies of two nations that once held vastly different positions on the procedure. The text message Cynthia Menchaca received this summer was one she was seeing more and more: A woman living in Texas said she had left a violent relationship only to discover she was pregnant, and she desperately wanted an abortion. The woman had learned that Ms. Menchaca could send her abortion pills from Mexico, where the procedure has been decriminalized in several states."
Louisiana,Q3,Many of the industry’s key materials are made with forced labor. It’s never been cheaper or easier to produce electricity from the sun.
Louisiana,Q3,"The bipartisan group, facing enormous opposition from Democrats, hopes a new policy document will advance its political cause — and possible third-party White House run. A new political platform focused on cooperative governance by the bipartisan group No Labels has something for everyone to embrace — and just as much for both sides to reject."
Louisiana,Q3,"A new plan to sell offshore drilling rights will be limited to three spots, all in the Gulf of Mexico. The Biden administration announced Friday it would lease a handful of spots in the Gulf of Mexico to oil companies for drilling over the next five years, a move that angered Republicans, the fossil fuel industry and climate activists alike."
Louisiana,Q3,"The toll of devastating wildfires in Maui. A summer of ferocious weather across much of the U.S. has now yielded the nation’s deadliest wildfire in more than a century. On the Hawaiian island of Maui, at least 93 people have been confirmed dead, more than 2,200 buildings have been leveled and many people on the island remain unaccounted for after what began as scattered brush fires quickly escalated."
Louisiana,Q3,"Utah is working to restrict teenage social media usage. Jane Coaston interviews Gov. Spencer Cox about why — and what’s the limit of government power. How much should 14-year-olds be on their phones? The effects of phones and social media on teenagers — and adults — continue to be at the center of public health, tech, civil liberties and more."
Louisiana,Q3,A judge’s decision to limit how the administration can interact with platforms could chill the White House’s efforts to utilize and police big tech. Government efforts to interact with social media platforms took a major hit on Tuesday when a federal judge restricted the Biden administration from communicating with tech companies about a broad array of online content.

Louisiana,Q3,"Republicans loaded the measure with a raft of social policy provisions — including limits on abortions, gender transition procedures and diversity training — that have little chance of surviving in the Senate. Republicans on Friday rammed through the House a deeply partisan defense bill that would limit abortion access, transgender care and diversity training for military personnel, setting up a showdown with the Senate. The coming fight could imperil the crucial annual measure to provide a pay raise for troops, set defense policy to counter U.S. adversaries and sustain Pentagon programs at a time of rising threats."
Louisiana,Q3,"The Alabama Republican’s bid to force the Pentagon to drop a policy ensuring access to abortion services for personnel could leave the Joint Chiefs of Staff with more temporary occupants than it has ever faced. A lone Senate Republican’s bid to reverse a Pentagon policy ensuring abortion access for service members is delaying the smooth transfer of power at the highest echelons of the armed forces, including in the ranks of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a monthslong partisan dispute over social policy drags on."
Louisiana,Q3,"President Biden has promised to provide every American access to reliable high-speed internet. But some have raised concerns about whether the funds will achieve all of the administration’s goals. Along the southeastern edge of Oklahoma, where expansive cattle ranches and empty storefronts dot the landscape, the lack of high-speed internet service has become a daily frustration for residents."
Louisiana,Q3,The opioid epidemic is a nightmare. Revisiting draconian drug sentencing laws will make it worse. Stories of narcotics-related death and debasement flooded the media. Politicians stoked panic about marijuana. Parents feared that teenagers would tip into addiction. Congress held hearings.
Louisiana,Q3,"Around the country, developers are building microgrids — energy-resilient communities that act as their own energy source. As retirement neared, Eric and Camela Moulder decided to downsize from their four-bedroom home in West Grove, Pa. They had two main goals: find a place near the beach, and reduce their living expenses."
Louisiana,Q3,"The couple were wed Sept. 8 in an intimate ceremony at their home in Farmington, Conn. The newlyweds spoke to The New York Times in an exclusive interview about their relationship. On a recent Thursday morning, after ABC’s “Good Morning America” had finished its broadcast, Robin Rene Roberts and Amber Laign sat in the corner table of a restaurant a couple hundred feet away from the studio."
Louisiana,Q3,"At age 17, Donnell Drinks was one of many young men in Philadelphia who went to prison for life without parole. Today, the city has resentenced more of those prisoners than any other jurisdiction. Donnell Drinks woke up one morning to banging on his door in the projects of North Philadelphia. It was the late 1980s, and Mr. Drinks, who was 15 and the oldest of three boys, had nodded off after taking his youngest brother to school. He should have been at school himself, but he had stopped going earlier that year. It wasn’t a truant officer at his door, though — no one had ever come knocking about that. Instead, sheriff’s deputies were waiting outside. They were there to evict his family."
Louisiana,Q3,"For a group of men in a Texas prison, the fantasy game became a lifeline — to their imaginations, and to one another. The first time Tony Ford played Dungeons & Dragons, he was a wiry Black kid who had never seen the inside of a prison. His mother, a police officer in Detroit, had quit the force and moved the family to West Texas. To Ford, it seemed like a different world. Strangers talked funny, and El Paso was half desert. But he could skateboard in all that open space, and he eventually befriended a nerdy white kid with a passion for Dungeons & Dragons. Ford fell in love with the role-playing game right away; it was complex and cerebral, a saga you could lose yourself in. And in the 1980s, everyone seemed to be playing it."
Louisiana,Q3,"The July 7, 2023, episode of “The Ezra Klein Show.” Every Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation about something that matters, like today’s episode with Robinson Meyer. Listen wherever you get your podcasts."
Louisiana,Q4,"Plus a treasure trove of ancient maps. Al-Shifa, Gaza’s main hospital complex, has been cut off from electricity for days. Hospital officials warn that the lives of roughly three dozen premature babies are under threat now that the incubators needed to keep them alive are without power."
Louisiana,Q4,"A marriage contract that makes divorce difficult is a way for some couples to protect their partnerships. However, some experts believe that this type of union has both advantages and disadvantages. Many states in America, depending on state-specific laws, allow “no-fault” divorces, in which either partner can end their marriage for any reason. But with a covenant marriage, there are stricter guidelines for ending a marriage. Revelations concerning Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, and his own covenant marriage have brought the unconventional commitment arrangement into the spotlight."
Louisiana,Q4,"The shooting in Lewiston that left 18 dead prompted the town’s conservative Democratic representative to embrace an assault weapons ban, but Senators Susan Collins and Angus King are still resisting. The mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, coupled with a conservative Democratic congressman’s reversal on an assault weapons ban, has turned the spotlight on the state’s two senators, Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, and Angus King, a Democrat-leaning independent, both of whom are skeptical about banning military-style rifles."
Louisiana,Q4,"With post-Roe outrage showing no sign of waning, strategists on the right are pushing a new lexicon on abortion. In the year since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the Republican Party has tested out constantly changing talking points and messages on abortion in an attempt to make its anti-abortion policies sound less extreme. Conservatives are even considering moving away from the term “pro-life,” fearing that voters have newly negative associations with the label."
Louisiana,Q4,"As we clean up the air, we also seem to making warming a bit worse. Some good news: The air we breathe has been getting cleaner. "
Louisiana,Q4,"The Justice Department inquiry will focus on “credible allegations” that a number of deaths at two jails resulted from use of force, medical neglect and assaults by inmates. The Justice Department on Thursday opened a far-reaching civil rights investigation of two troubled jails in South Carolina after reports of violent and unhealthy living conditions, failure to treat mentally ill prisoners and the abuse of inmates by guards."
Louisiana,Q4,"Also, salty drinking water threatens lower Louisiana. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. President Biden met today with Xi Jinping, the president of China, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in California. It was their first conversation in a year, and both leaders framed the meeting as a step toward easing tensions that had dramatically worsened in recent years. “Planet Earth is big enough” for both superpowers, Xi said, adding that their countries should be “fully capable of rising above differences.”"
Louisiana,Q4,"Our mortality crisis is much larger than “deaths of despair.” Since it was first introduced by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton in 2015, the phrase “deaths of despair” has become a sort of spiritual skeleton key that promised to unlock the whole tragic story of a new American underclass."
Louisiana,Q4,"The court also agreed to hear the administration’s appeal, paving the way for a major ruling on how far government can go to encourage sites to delete asserted misinformation. The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Biden administration officials to continue to contact social media platforms to combat what the officials say is misinformation, pausing a sweeping ruling from a federal appeals court that had severely limited such interactions."
Louisiana,Q4,"The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term. The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows."
Louisiana,Q4,"As Congress struggles to do the bare minimum of keeping the government funded, House Republicans are using the annual federal spending bills to try to punish the Biden administration. Just before hard-right House Republicans staged a floor mutiny over spending on Wednesday that sent lawmakers home early for their Thanksgiving break, they managed one final vote, on a measure to reduce the salary of an obscure Biden administration official to $1."
Louisiana,Q4,Biden calls for more aid into Gaza. President Biden called for more aid into Gaza and assurances that the help was reaching those who needed it most amid a growing humanitarian crisis.
Louisiana,Q4,"Also, a surprisingly powerful hurricane hit Mexico. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. After three weeks of legislative paralysis and intraparty fighting, the narrow House Republican majority finally united this afternoon around a new leader. Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, with all 220 Republicans in favor and all 209 Democrats in opposition, was elected as the 56th speaker of the House of Representatives."
Louisiana,Q4,"The Upshot staff shares a selection of their favorite charts, documents, queries and calculations from the past year. The Upshot staff shares a selection of their favorite charts, documents, queries and calculations from the past year."
Louisiana,Q4,"With aid to Ukraine and Israel in limbo, a border deal elusive and a mountain of spending legislation left undone, the House turned its attention to whole milk in schools. With one day to go until Congress plans to call it quits for the year and members head home for the holidays, the House got down to pressing business on Wednesday, using its precious remaining time to pass legislation to bring whole milk back to America’s school cafeterias."
Louisiana,Q4,"The resolution pledges to support Israel with whatever it needs as it fights Hamas. It passed overwhelmingly, but a small group of mostly Democratic holdouts remained. The House voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to pass a resolution declaring solidarity with Israel, pledging to give its government whatever security assistance it needs to fight and win its war with Hamas."
Louisiana,Q4,"Plus, food trends in 2024 Ukraine said today it had destroyed the Russian warship Novocherkassk in Crimea, one of the most significant attacks against Moscow’s Black Sea Fleet in months. But in a setback, Ukraine acknowledged that it had largely retreated from the eastern city of Marinka after a monthslong battle."
Louisiana,Q4,"The new Republican speaker is facing fury from ultraconservative lawmakers for agreeing to drop limits on abortion, transgender care and diversity training. The annual defense bill has become entangled in a tumultuous Republican feud in the House, as hard-right lawmakers revolt over a bipartisan agreement to jettison a raft of deeply partisan dictates that would have limited abortion access, transgender care and diversity training."
Louisiana,Q4,Plus Vietnam’s many cable cars. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepened yesterday as Israel said it had conducted “wide-scale” strikes and again warned residents in Gaza to flee south ahead of a possible invasion. 
Louisiana,Q4,"A thread of mismanaged postpartum depression and grief — and how it destroyed generations of her family — runs through the book. The first chapter of Britney Spears’s new memoir, “The Woman in Me,” includes the story of her paternal grandmother, Emma Jean Spears, called Jean; everybody says Britney Spears looks like her, but that’s not the only thing they have in common."
Louisiana,Q4,"The new speaker played a pivotal role in congressional efforts to overturn the 2020 election and opposes abortion rights and gay marriage. When Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana wanted to make the case against abortion rights last year during a Capitol Hill committee hearing, he grilled a witness in graphic fashion."
Louisiana,Q4,"Multiple lawmakers refused to honor their party’s internal selection of Steve Scalise, continuing the chaos over the speakership with no end in sight. Republicans used to consider themselves the orderly party, the one that assiduously adhered to the rules and respected the will of the majority. But the traditional rule book has been thrown out the window when it comes to the extraordinary tumult in the House."
Louisiana,Q4,"The help Americans receive after disasters isn’t just inadequate; it’s complicated to navigate and painfully slow to arrive. This summer, 12 people let me into their lives to tell me about their experiences in the aftermath of disasters, including hurricanes, floods, freezes, wildfires and derechos. All said, they did not receive the aid they expected, and the effects have been devastating. “It’s been a very humbling experience, to say the least, to go from ‘We’re fine, we just got a new house, we have a huge savings, biggest we’ve ever had’ to ‘You have nothing and you lost everything and you have to go to food pantries for food,’” said Aleasha LeClere, whose life was turned upside down by a 2020 derecho in Iowa. According to research on disasters and advocacy groups, these survivors’ experiences are very much the norm."
Louisiana,Q4,"Migrant children, put to work in one of the nation’s most dangerous jobs, are falling and dying. Migrant children, put to work in one of the nation’s most dangerous jobs, are falling and dying."
Louisiana,Q4,"A recent change in antitrust law made it easier for the singers to bypass big movie studios when seeking distribution for their concert films. Just before Taylor Swift’s concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” passed $100 million in global ticket presales this week, its distributor, AMC Entertainment, announced that it had struck a similar deal with Beyoncé for the singer’s Renaissance tour. Both projects follow tours that became cultural phenomena and pushed sales records, and the films are expected to be hits themselves."
Louisiana,Q4,"A report about when employees discovered a secret link between the crypto exchange and a sister trading firm raises questions as witnesses started testifying. The first witnesses for the fraud trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the fallen crypto exchange FTX,  began to testify on Wednesday, as prosecutors and defense lawyers squared off on whether the company failed because of fraud."
Louisiana,Q4,Montana is at the forefront of a wave of new tech laws passed by Republican-led states. Some give parents control over their children’s social media accounts. Many of the world’s largest consumer technology companies will be closely monitoring a federal court hearing in Montana on Thursday that could decide whether TikTok will have to stop operating in the state next year.
Louisiana,Q4,"The U.N. calls for a cease-fire in Israel and Gaza. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, called yesterday for a humanitarian cease-fire in Israel and Gaza in an address to the U.N. Security Council. He said that the attacks by Hamas that had left 1,400 people dead in Israel on Oct. 7 were “appalling” but that they did not justify the “collective punishment” of civilians in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military significantly stepped up its bombardment."
Louisiana,Q4,The rally was a response to large protests across the United States and the world denouncing the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Demonstrators from across the United States gathered on Tuesday on the National Mall in Washington in a vast show of solidarity with Israel as it wages war in the Gaza Strip in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.
Louisiana,Q4,"The Republican Party is in disarray. In the past three weeks, House Republicans have dumped their party leader — Speaker Kevin McCarthy — and repeatedly failed to elect the candidate whom they had nominated to replace McCarthy."
Louisiana,Q4,"Elections in Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia will give an early preview of how abortion will shape the political landscape in 2024, and the effectiveness of both parties’ approaches. Follow our live updates from Election Day 2023."
Louisiana,Q4,"Despite conflicts overseas and an approaching deadline to avert a government shutdown, Republicans are unable to rise above their internal divisions. Two key U.S. allies are engulfed in vicious wars. A disruptive government shutdown is looming in just over a month. Americans are held hostage overseas by hostile forces. Uncertainty ripples across the country."
Louisiana,Q4,"President Biden put pressure on Xi Jinping to crack down on the Chinese facilities that make chemical compounds used in potent drugs. President Biden pressed the Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday to crack down on the Chinese firms that are helping to produce fentanyl, a potent drug that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans."
Louisiana,Q4,"A Republican leadership vacuum has allowed the former president to exert power over his party — and in the country — in a way that lacks much historical precedent. From a House leadership contest to the southwestern border and a foreign war, Donald J. Trump’s influence this week seemed to pervade the nation’s politics more than it has since the first weeks after his exit from the White House."
Louisiana,Q4,"Also, House Republicans struggle to choose a leader. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. Israel moved troops into position for a multipronged invasion of the Gaza Strip in an effort to dismantle Hamas, the militant group who massacred more than 1,200 Israelis in an attack over the weekend. "
Louisiana,Q4,"Stocks and bonds have tumbled worldwide, with the 30-year Treasury bill hitting a 16-year high. Investors are worried about the economy’s health. A far-right mutiny on Capitol Hill has sent markets into a tailspin. Skittish investors have dumped stocks and bonds this morning on fears that chaos in the Republican Party will cause a government shutdown next month and all but squash the fleeting hopes of a soft-landing economic recovery heading into an election year."
Louisiana,Q4,"After their party was decimated in the 2008 elections, mainstream Republican leaders believed they could harness rising far-right populist forces. Instead, they were overrun by them. The roots of the Republican crackup this fall that paralyzed the House, fueled the unexpected rise of Speaker Mike Johnson and now threatens to force a government shutdown crisis early next year lie in a fateful choice the party made more than a decade ago that has come back to haunt its leaders."
Louisiana,Q4,"By splitting money for Israel’s war effort from aid to Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, Speaker Mike Johnson has put the House on a collision course with the Senate and President Biden. Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to force a stand-alone vote on aid for Israel, peeling off a request from the Biden administration for money from Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, has set up a confrontation between the House and Senate over how to fund U.S. allies during the conflicts."
Louisiana,Q4,"For centuries, labor was deemed too messy a subject for gallery walls. A growing canon of feminist work is challenging that perception. Not long after completing “The Dinner Party” (1974-79), her monumental installation dedicated to historical women, the artist Judy Chicago began researching depictions of birth in Western art — only to discover there were almost none. “If men had babies, there would be thousands of images of the crowning,” she said. In an effort to fill this void, she went straight to the source. She witnessed a live birth — the San Francisco-based designer Karin Hibma agreed to let Chicago sketch in the delivery room — and sent detailed questionnaires to more than 100 mothers. (Sample questions: Why did you want to have a baby? What physical changes have become permanent?) Part of her resulting work, “The Birth Project” series (1980-85), made up of painted, woven and embroidered images of women in labor, is currently on view at Chicago’s retrospective at the New Museum in New York. Many of the images are epic in tone and size: Breasts become mountains and rivers flow from between open legs. Chicago was, as she later wrote, “building a form language almost ‘from scratch,’” one that linked the act of birth to divine creation. But to this day, according to Massimiliano Gioni, one of the show’s curators, the series has never been shown in full."
Louisiana,Q4,"Readers share why they adore living in the Golden State. When it comes to waxing poetic about California, certain spots tend to get the most love. Among them: the palm-tree-lined beaches of Los Angeles, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the stunning waterfalls and granite mountains of Yosemite National Park."
Louisiana,Q4,"Every year, the agency tries to claw back billions in overpaid benefits — including from children who are unaware their parents collected money on their behalf. Kree Flowers had recently gotten married and decided to log into her account on the Social Security Administration’s website in February to check on the status of her retirement benefits. She was shocked to see a big red number at the top of the page. According to the agency, she had been overpaid by $17,121.21."
Louisiana,Q4,"For the first time in the history of the House of Representatives, its members fired their leader in the middle of a term. In the 234-year history of the House of Representatives, its members had never voted to fire their leader in the middle of a term. They did so yesterday."
Louisiana,Q4,"He wanted to put a face on the source of cells that led to striking medical advances, and through him a best seller and a movie did just that, telling Mrs. Lacks’s story. Roland A. Pattillo, a gynecologic oncologist who had been treating and researching female cancers for decades, had long been haunted by the curious case of Henrietta Lacks, a young, impoverished Black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951 yet whose cells lived on and made medical history."
Louisiana,Q4,"Businesses, schools and offices in the southern part of the state were closed on Thursday as the authorities sought a 40-year-old suspect. The familiar rituals of a Wednesday night were playing out at Just-In-Time Recreation, a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, with 22 lanes of tenpin and a restaurant serving nachos and wings."
Louisiana,Q4,"The price of crude oil has risen and global markets are under pressure as the death toll exceeds 1,100 and Israel begins a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip. More than 1,100 are dead as Israel fights to drive out Palestinian militants from towns near the Gaza Strip, two days after hundreds of Israelis were killed or captured in surprise attacks. Israel just ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza, as rockets continue to land on both sides of the border and Israeli forces prepare for a potential ground invasion."
Louisiana,Q4,"The pop star’s new book, “The Woman in Me,” recounts her rise to fame, struggles that became tabloid fodder and her efforts to escape a conservatorship that long governed her life. There came a point during the 13 years that a conservatorship strictly governed Britney Spears’s life and career that she gave up fighting it, the singer recalls in her memoir, “The Woman in Me,” which is being released on Tuesday."
Louisiana,Q4,"The baseball playoffs and the sport’s biggest problem. The final game of the playoff series between the Houston Astros and the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday lasted only two hours and 38 minutes. It was a crisply played game — which the Astros won, 3-2 — that highlighted Major League Baseball’s biggest accomplishment this season. Thanks to a 15-second clock that prevents players from dawdling between pitches, the average game lasted just two hours and 40 minutes this season, down a remarkable 24 minutes from last season."
Louisiana,Q4,"Wall Street’s most closely watched succession saga ended with the selection of Ted Pick as the bank’s next leader. But he now must keep the momentum going. One of Wall Street’s most closely watched succession races is over as Ted Pick prepares to become Morgan Stanley’s next chief executive. He will take the baton in January from James Gorman, who since 2010 has transformed the firm from an investment bank into an asset-management behemoth."
Louisiana,Q4,"An altercation in San Francisco has raised fears about the city’s future — but also questions about what really happened. Responding to 911 calls about a street fight in the Marina district, the police found Don Carmignani, 53, standing on the sidewalk with blood streaming down his face. It was 7:20 p.m. on April 5 — twilight — and multiple witnesses had gotten a clean view of Carmignani’s attacker: a young homeless man who was a familiar presence in the neighborhood. The police arrested him two minutes later, right down the block. An ambulance took Carmignani to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital."
Louisiana,Q4,"From wildfires to wars, labor strikes to political protests, 2023 was a big year. All year long, we photographed the people whose lives were shaped by the news. From wildfires to wars, labor strikes to political protests, 2023 was a big year. All year long, we photographed the people whose lives were shaped by the news."
Maine,Q1,"The fatal shooting was the first since the area was designated a “gun-free zone” in response to a Supreme Court ruling striking down the state’s firearms law. Last year, New York lawmakers declared Times Square a gun-free zone, a move intended to respond to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down the state’s firearms law and to protect the blazingly lit tourism magnet as it rebounded from the pandemic.  "
Maine,Q1,"The centrist West Virginia Democrat, who faces re-election in 2024, has made it clear he believes he can help broker a compromise to raise the debt ceiling. WASHINGTON — As Democrats unleashed relentless criticism against Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week, portraying him as a reckless politician willing to force the country into default and slash bedrock entitlement programs, one of their own spoke up in the top Republican’s defense: Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia."
Maine,Q1,"The meeting, which did not appear to yield a breakthrough, highlighted the differences between the White House and the Republicans who now control the House. WASHINGTON — President Biden told Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday that there was room for discussion about addressing America’s deficit, even as he insisted that Congress would have to pass a debt-limit increase with no strings attached to avoid a financial cataclysm."

Maine,Q1,"Also, Poland says it will give Ukraine warplanes and Japan extends a hand to South Korea. President Emmanuel Macron pushed through contentious legislation to raise France’s retirement age — without a full vote in parliament. The decision inflamed tensions and set the stage for a no-confidence vote against his government."

Wilson Grad Conn wasn’t going to let his dating inexperience become a liability when he started seeing Rachel Lyn Honig in the fall of 2019."
Maine,Q1,"Doing taxes in 2023 feels a lot like it did before the pandemic. Still, there are some meaningful changes to keep in mind. The 2023 tax filing season is probably most notable for what’s missing: After three years of stimulus payments and pandemic tax breaks, nearly all of those extra benefits have faded away — and tax refunds are likely to shrink as a result."
Maine,Q1,"“That toothsome meal arguably saved the Republic,” says the journalist, whose new book is “Dinner With the President: Food, Politics, and a History of Breaking Bread at the White House,” of Thomas Jefferson’s so-called Dinner Table Bargain. “The debate at Jefferson’s reverberates today.” I have a colorful pile of books that is slowly accreting by my bed, and occasionally sets off a landslide. At the moment the stratum includes: George Saunders’s “A Swim in a Pond in the Rain,” Geoff Dyer’s “The Last Days of Roger Federer,” Toni Tipton-Martin’s “Jubilee” cookbook, Patti Smith’s “M Train,” Mark Strand’s “Hopper,” Mark Rozzo’s “Everybody Thought We Were Crazy,” Ian Fleming’s “Thrilling Cities” (a 1963 travelogue picked up for 10 cents), Sally Mann’s “Hold Still” and a substrate of magazines and catalogs. I dip in and out of these books before sleep, or when I’m procrastinating, and will eventually finish them all. Or not."
Maine,Q1,"Known as informal removals, the tactics are “off-the-book” suspensions often in violation of federal civil rights protections for those with disabilities. ROSEBURG, Ore. — Jessica LaVigne was nervous but hopeful on a recent afternoon that the team managing her son’s special education plan at Roseburg High School would tell her something she had dreamed of for more than a decade: He would be able to attend a full day of school for the first time since second grade."
Maine,Q1,"A Pulitzer Prize-winning sociologist offers a new explanation for an intractable problem. In the past 50 years, scientists have mapped the entire human genome and eradicated smallpox. Here in the United States, infant-mortality rates and deaths from heart disease have fallen by roughly 70 percent, and the average American has gained almost a decade of life. Climate change was recognized as an existential threat. The internet was invented."

Maine,Q2,"In Justin Cronin’s novel “The Ferryman,” residents of  enjoy respectable, cultured lives — until their memories are wiped. For a science-fictional utopia created by a reclusive “Designer,” the world of “The Ferryman” bears a startling resemblance to the well-heeled strata of, say, San Francisco or New York. People fetch soy lattes after yoga, “flushed with high-minded health.” They live in self-designed houses overlooking the sea, hold season tickets to the opera, have careers as couturiers and art dealers and vintners."
Maine,Q2,President Lincoln and Republicans in Congress recognized that preserving America’s credit was the key to financing the Civil War and therefore to the government’s survival. The looming American debt crisis is politically contrived. The Treasury could borrow all it needed if the Republican majority in the House acted responsibly and raised the debt ceiling.
Maine,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Maine,Q2,"The final vote on Thursday night came after leaders put down a revolt by some senators who raised concerns that the debt-limit package would under-fund the Pentagon. After weeks of political impasse, tense negotiations and mounting economic anxiety, the Senate gave final approval on Thursday night to bipartisan legislation suspending the debt limit and imposing new spending caps, sending it to President Biden and ending the possibility of a calamitous government default."
Maine,Q2,"Take some seasonal inspiration from what readers of The Morning are planning. Years ago, I received a voicemail from the neighborhood cobbler telling me my shoes were ready to pick up. The message was perfunctory, left by the shop owner, a usually grumpy guy who sounded like his usually grumpy self. But instead of ending with “OK, bye” or “have a good day” or some other cliché, he signed off with “Enjoy your time.”"

Maine,Q2,"The people who believe he is going to save America. Before Covid, Gabe Whitney, a 41-year-old from West Bath, Maine, didn’t think much about vaccines. He wasn’t very political — he didn’t vote in 2020, he said, because he thought Donald Trump was a “psycho” and Joe Biden was “corrupt.” It wasn’t until the pandemic that Whitney started regularly watching the news, but as he did, he felt that things weren’t adding up. He doubted what he called “the narrative” and struggled with the hostility his questions about vaccines and other mitigations elicited from those close to him. He described being “blamed and labeled as someone who’s part of the problem because you’re questioning. Like not taking a stance on it, but just questioning. That was the worst.”"

Maine,Q3,"The increase in poverty reversed two years of large declines. Median income, adjusted for inflation, fell 2.3 percent to $74,580. Poverty increased sharply last year in the United States, particularly among children, as living costs rose and federal programs that provided aid to families during the pandemic were allowed to expire."
Maine,Q3,"Once a vaccine advocate, the Florida governor lost his enthusiasm for the shot before the Delta wave sent Covid hospitalizations and deaths soaring. It’s a grim chapter he now leaves out of his rosy retelling of his pandemic response. On a Saturday in September 2020, with Covid-19 killing more than 600 Americans daily and hundreds of thousands of deaths still to come, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, heard her cellphone ring. It was Dr. Scott Rivkees, the Florida surgeon general. He was distraught."
Maine,Q3,"The mayor of Woburn, where hotels are housing 150 migrant families, said the state’s 40-year-old right-to-shelter law “was not meant to cover what we’re seeing now.” Barely two weeks had passed since the migrant crisis arrived in their city of 40,000 people, 10 miles northwest of Boston, but the volunteers gathered at a church in Woburn on a recent evening sounded battle weary."

Maine,Q3,"Also, autoworkers prepare for a strike. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. Federal prosecutors charged Hunter Biden, the president’s son, with lying about his drug use when he purchased a handgun in 2018. The indictment could lead to a high-profile trial of Biden next year, coinciding with his father’s re-election campaign."
Maine,Q3,"Proponents of the measure to enshrine a guarantee of sex equality into the Constitution are using a creative legal theory to try to resurrect the long-stalled amendment. Democrats in Congress are making a fresh push for the nearly century-old Equal Rights Amendment to be enshrined in the Constitution, rallying around a creative legal theory in a bid to revive an amendment that would explicitly guarantee sex equality as a way to protect reproductive rights in post-Roe America."

Maine,Q3,"State flags mix aesthetics and nostalgia. Flags flutter over every state capital in the U.S. They bear emblems symbolizing the states they represent: a boldface C for Colorado, a lone star for Texas. They adorn magnets, mugs and T-shirts. They fly at half-staff in mourning."
Maine,Q3,"An agreement between Senate Republicans and Democrats would keep agencies open through mid-November and provide billions in aid for Ukraine and disaster relief. But House Republicans are likely to balk. Senate Republicans and Democrats reached agreement on Tuesday on a stopgap spending plan that would head off a government shutdown on Sunday while providing billions in disaster relief and aid to Ukraine, but the measure faced resistance in the Republican-led House."

For the staff of the Michigan State University dining halls, serving roughly 27,000 students each semester has never been a picnic.

Maine,Q3,"The bipartisan group, facing enormous opposition from Democrats, hopes a new policy document will advance its political cause — and possible third-party White House run. A new political platform focused on cooperative governance by the bipartisan group No Labels has something for everyone to embrace — and just as much for both sides to reject."
Maine,Q3,"Republicans are making big promises about combating fentanyl. Their words ring hollow to some who know too much about the drug’s deadly toll. The official toxicology report states that Andrea Cahill’s son died at 19 years old from an accidental fentanyl overdose. But more than three years after Tyler Cahill’s death in his childhood bedroom, she doesn’t believe that. It was a poisoning, she says, and there is no question about whom to blame: “the cartels.”"
Maine,Q3,"A Connecticut law allows residents to kill bears in certain circumstances. But some residents want a full-fledged bear hunt, allowed in almost every nearby state.

He was 66."
Maine,Q3,"Also, a new phase of Ukraine’s offensive. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. Federal Reserve officials raised interest rates today to their highest level in 22 years, pressing on with a campaign to bring inflation down by cooling the American economy.

Then, when she jumped into the Democratic primary, she was encouraged by still other formidable allies."
Maine,Q3,"Chronic pain, fatigue, rashes: As tick territories are expanding, so too are the number of illnesses they cause. When Reema Shah was 13 years old, she became plagued by a mysterious suite of symptoms: rashes, brain fog, fatigue. Her exhaustion was so extreme that walking up stairs would leave her winded, and she had to quit her high school tennis team; she could barely even keep up with her schoolwork."
Maine,Q3,"Republicans loaded the measure with a raft of social policy provisions — including limits on abortions, gender transition procedures and diversity training — that have little chance of surviving in the Senate. Republicans on Friday rammed through the House a deeply partisan defense bill that would limit abortion access, transgender care and diversity training for military personnel, setting up a showdown with the Senate. The coming fight could imperil the crucial annual measure to provide a pay raise for troops, set defense policy to counter U.S. adversaries and sustain Pentagon programs at a time of rising threats."

He impressed some clients and drove others crazy with his fine-toothed directives."
Maine,Q3,"The Teamsters and management have surprisingly strong ties. Every intense relationship has frictions, and the one between the Teamsters union and United Parcel Service is no exception. Negotiations have broken down in the final stage of talks on a five-year contract, with the Teamsters vowing to strike if a new contract isn’t ratified by the time the current one expires on July 31. Each side has accused the other of walking away from the bargaining table."
Maine,Q3,"A hunter’s kill in upstate New York brought new hope, and trepidation, that wolves could slowly be making their way back to the Northeast. The rustling in the brush was loud, so Brian Christman raised his muzzleloader for the deer he expected to emerge. It was the end of the season in central New York, and Mr. Christman was hoping to take home a buck."
Maine,Q3,"At a time when lawmakers and parents are seeking to restrict what can and cannot be taught in classrooms, many teachers are seeing efforts to limit what can be staged in their auditoriums.

Maine,Q3,
Maine,Q4,"The assailant in the mass shooting in Lewiston died about eight to 12 hours before his body was found, officials say. The gunman who fled after killing 18 people and injuring 13 others at a bar and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, last month was most likely alive during much of the sprawling two-day manhunt that had forced thousands of residents throughout the region to remain in their homes."
Maine,Q4,"Robert R. Card Jr. was found dead Friday night in Lisbon, Maine, near a recycling center where he once worked and the boat ramp where his car was left. A two-day manhunt ended Friday when the authorities in Maine said they had found Robert R. Card Jr., 40, dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. Mr. Card was suspected of fatally shooting 18 people and wounding 13 others at a bowling alley and a bar in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday."
Maine,Q4,"The sheriff said the gunman had made threats against the Army base where he was assigned, prompting an alert to all law enforcement agencies in the state weeks before the mass shooting. A sheriff in Maine says he sent an alert to all law enforcement agencies in the state last month after learning that an Army reservist had made threats against his base, a notification that came weeks before the reservist fatally shot 18 people in America’s deadliest mass shooting this year."
Maine,Q4,"The body of the man suspected of killing 18 and injuring 13 others in Lewiston was found with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound late Friday. The man suspected of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others at a bar and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound on Friday, officials said, ending a sweeping manhunt that had forced thousands of residents throughout the region to remain in their homes."
Maine,Q4,"The attack, in which four of the 18 people killed were Deaf, resurfaced previous traumas and came after decades of efforts to be recognized. As residents across Maine sat riveted to their TVs on Oct. 27, waiting anxiously for updates on the manhunt for a gunman who had killed 18 people, state officials opened their news briefing with a stern directive for the cameras in the room."
Maine,Q4,"Businesses, schools and offices in the southern part of the state were closed on Thursday as the authorities sought a 40-year-old suspect. The familiar rituals of a Wednesday night were playing out at Just-In-Time Recreation, a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, with 22 lanes of tenpin and a restaurant serving nachos and wings."
Maine,Q4,"Also, U.S. economic growth accelerates. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. Hundreds of police officers combed a vast, largely rural area of Maine, hunting for the suspect in shootings last night that killed 18 people and injured 13 others in a crowded bowling alley and at a bar in Lewiston."
Maine,Q4,"That position, he said, reflected in part “a false confidence that our community was above this, and that we could be in full control, among many other misjudgments.” Representative Jared Golden of Maine, a centrist Democrat, called for a ban on assault weapons Thursday afternoon, reversing a long-held stance after 18 people were killed in a mass shooting in Lewiston."
Maine,Q4,"The man was found dead on Friday night, ending a two-day manhunt. The police said he had legally purchased several guns, including in recent days. The man who killed 18 people and wounded 13 more in Lewiston, Maine, the deadliest mass shooting in America this year, had paranoid beliefs that people were talking about him, and he may have been hearing voices, the authorities said on Saturday."
Maine,Q4,"President Biden met with the families of those killed or injured during last month’s rampage in Maine, which killed 18 people. Since taking office, President Biden has traveled a grim path through American communities desperately grieving in the wake of mass shootings: Uvalde, Texas; Monterey Park, Calif.; Buffalo; Atlanta."
Maine,Q4,"Someone on the run can take advantage of natural cover to elude a manhunt for awhile, but experts say technology and time will eventually tip the scales toward the pursuers. After gunning down 18 people and wounding 13 more in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, the man who carried out the rampage apparently fled the small city, disappearing into a forested region that may — for now — help keep him a step ahead of the police."
Maine,Q4,"Hospitals are playing a growing role in abortion access, as pregnant women with certain health issues travel to seek care that clinics can’t provide. Hospitals are playing a growing role in abortion access, as pregnant women with certain health issues travel to seek care that clinics can’t provide."
Maine,Q4,"The “Late Show” host chided the new House speaker for offering little more than thoughts and prayers to survivors of the Maine shooting on his first day in office. Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now."
Maine,Q4,"State officials said the situation at New Hampshire Hospital, a state psychiatric facility in Concord, had been “contained.” The motive for the shooting remained unclear. A gunman fatally shot a security officer inside the lobby of a state psychiatric hospital in Concord, N.H., on Friday afternoon and then was killed shortly afterward by a state trooper patrolling the campus, state officials said."
Maine,Q4,Data shows where a record number of unaccompanied children traveling to the U.S. from Central America and other countries have ended up. Data shows where a record number of unaccompanied children traveling to the U.S. from Central America and other countries have ended up.
Maine,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Maine,Q4,"Also, police scour a river for the gunman in Maine. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. The Israeli military launched an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip this evening and said it was “expanding” its activity there. Cellular and internet service were cut off for much of the territory, and Palestinians said fear and panic were spreading."
Maine,Q4,"Mississippi has long had high childhood immunization rates, but a federal judge has ordered the state to allow parents to opt out on religious grounds. For more than 40 years, Mississippi had one of the strictest school vaccination requirements in the nation, and its high childhood immunization rates have been a source of pride. But in July, the state began excusing children from vaccination if their parents cited religious objections, after a federal judge sided with a “medical freedom” group."
Maine,Q4,"Articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."
Maine,Q4,"PEPFAR, created by President George W. Bush in 2003 to combat the disease, faces an uncertain future now that its authorizing legislation has lapsed. The institute founded by President George W. Bush issued an urgent call on Wednesday for Congress to renew the global AIDS program known as PEPFAR, a centerpiece of Mr. Bush’s foreign policy legacy that has become a victim of abortion politics on Capitol Hill."
Maine,Q4,"Also, the new speaker sets up a clash over military aid. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Airstrikes that Israel said were aimed at Hamas militants hit the densely populated area of Jabaliya in Gaza today, leaving a large crater and causing widespread damage."
Maine,Q4,"You won’t find a silver bullet in a single food, experts say, but there are some that may help you build the best defense. On average, more than one in three people in the United States will develop cancer at some point in their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society. And many of those cases, they say, can potentially be prevented, including by making changes to your diet."
Maine,Q4,"A new crop of popular social media personalities includes a trucker, a shepherd and a commercial fisherman. What they earn from sponsorships is just a nice bonus. It was another busy day for the crew of the Rest-Ashoar, a lobster fishing boat that works the waters off the rocky coast of Winter Harbor, Maine. The captain, Jacob Knowles, had gotten up at 3 a.m. on a brisk October morning and took his vessel 10 miles into the ocean."
Maine,Q4,"The influx of migrants is taxing the social safety net in the U.S. Will Democrats pay the price for it? For far too long, too many Americans considered the border to be someone else’s problem — someone in Texas, maybe, or Arizona or California. People who didn’t live near the border might have condemned harsh tactics used there or offered their communities as sanctuaries for those who managed to slip across it. But for the most part, the challenges of the border remained at the border. Out of sight, out of mind."
Maine,Q4,"How Adidas looked past misconduct in its partnership with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. When Adidas ended its wildly lucrative shoe deal with Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, a year ago, the breakup appeared to be the culmination of weeks of his inflammatory remarks about Jews and Black Lives Matter. But our examination found that behind the scenes, the partnership was fraught from the start."
Maine,Q4,"A new study found that the advertisements can be confusing and misleading. Here’s how to make smart buying decisions. If you’re enrolled in Medicare, you might want to turn off your television this time of year."
Maine,Q4,"Legal challenges are pending across the country against a federal law that prevents medical marijuana users from buying or owning firearms. For Vera Cooper, the time had come to buy a gun."
Maine,Q4,"A preview of an upcoming vote on abortion access in Ohio. On Tuesday, Ohio voters will decide whether to protect access to abortion in their state."
Maine,Q4,"Marches in Washington, D.C., Ohio, Utah and California, with tens of thousands of protesters, reflect the many different groups calling for a cease-fire and lifting of the siege in Gaza. Bearing flags and united in fury, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded the streets of American cities on Saturday to denounce the scope and scale of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in response to last month’s terrorist assault by Hamas. "
Maine,Q4,Pressure builds for a pause in Gaza. The leaders of the 27 E.U. nations called yesterday for a break in the fighting in Gaza to address a dire humanitarian crisis inside the territory. Their statement came hours after the Israeli military said it had briefly sent tanks into Gaza in preparation for the next stage of fighting.
Maine,Q4,"Plus the power of music at a volatile time. An Israeli strike aimed at Hamas militants, including a commander who helped plan the Oct. 7 massacre, hit a densely populated neighborhood in Gaza, leaving behind a massive crater and widespread damage."
Maine,Q4,"Also, Wisconsin was ordered to redraw its legislative maps. Here's the latest at the end of Friday. The Supreme Court declined today to decide whether Donald Trump is immune from prosecution on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Instead, the case will move forward in an appeals court and will most likely return to the Supreme Court in the coming months."
Maine,Q4,"Also, Donald Trump’s eldest sons testify in a fraud trial. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. When Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Israel tomorrow, he plans to urge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a series of brief cessations of military operations in Gaza, White House officials said today."
Maine,Q4,"Also, G.M. strikes a tentative deal with autoworkers The Israeli military advanced on Gaza City from at least three sides today as it battered the enclave with airstrikes. The deepest reach, about three miles, paralleled the Mediterranean coast toward the Shati refugee camp on the northern flank of the city. Here’s a map showing locations of Israeli troops in Gaza."
Maine,Q4,"Miniature bottles of alcohol known as “nips” litter gardens, parks and playgrounds, prompting the Witch City to propose a ban. The list of public nuisances in Salem, Mass., in high Halloween season is long and weird: Rowdy crowds imperiling 17th-century gravestones. Unlicensed fortune tellers. Skirmishes over parking spaces at Gallows Hill or the Museum of Torture."
Maine,Q4,"Some progress has been made on firearm violence in recent decades. American gun violence can feel like an unsolvable problem, with every mass shooting, like last week’s killings in Maine, affirming that the situation is getting worse. But the U.S. has in fact made some progress over the past few decades, enacting policies that have saved lives."
Maine,Q4,"Hamas needs its maze of tunnels to fight. But more than two million people live above the underground network, a layer of human life between military targets and Israeli missiles. There is a transportation network below Gaza, one that Israel is trying to destroy."
Maine,Q4,"Researchers say troops’ brains may be injured by blasts from firing M1 Abrams tank guns and other weapons, even if they measure below the Pentagon’s ceiling for safe exposure. Christian Beyer worked around the ground-shaking blasts of one of the Army’s most powerful weapons — the M1 Abrams tank — for 23 years. And for nearly all that time, he was a model soldier, given awards for meritorious service and promoted all the way up to master sergeant in charge of training young tank crews."
Maine,Q4,"A selection of stories that Times editors thought deserved more readers. Before the internet, there was no way for New York Times editors to know how many people had read an article. Stories that ran on the front page of the newspaper presumably were better read than ones on Page 36, but nobody could be sure."
Maine,Q4,"The American political system helped create today’s problems, and only the American political system can solve them. Many Americans have come to see the political system as rigged. They worry that grass-roots political movements are powerless to overcome entrenched interests, whether those interests are self-serving politicians, large employers or dominant social media platforms. And I understand why this cynicism exists."
Maine,Q4,"A majority of the Democratic caucus signed a letter asking President Biden to ensure that Israel has a viable plan for defeating Hamas and will use U.S. military assistance in keeping with international law. A majority of the Senate Democratic caucus called on President Biden on Wednesday to defend his request for $14.3 billion in emergency military assistance for Israel, seeking assurances that the Jewish state has a viable plan for defeating Hamas and that the United States will not be funding actions that run afoul of international and U.S. laws."
Maine,Q4,"Hamas’s campaign of sexual violence. A two-month investigation by The Times, including interviews with more than 150 people, uncovered painful new details about the attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7, established a pattern of gender-based sexual violence and identified at least seven locations where Israeli women and girls appeared to have been sexually assaulted or mutilated."
Maine,Q4,"We look at the evidence for who is responsible. Last month, a few days after the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, I walked you through the debate over who was responsible. At the time, there wasn’t much evidence that outsiders could assess on their own. The dispute revolved around competing claims from Israel and Hamas."
Maine,Q4,"The news media doesn’t often publish graphic images of dead children. But this photograph must be seen. If you don’t look too closely you might think the photograph is a dimly lit snapshot from a slumber party or a family camping trip. Six small children lie in a row, their heads poking out from the white sheet that is casually lying across their little chests. None appear to be older than 10, though it is hard to say for sure."
Maine,Q4,"The minority leader, who many believe could step down next year, has found himself out of step with many fellow Senate Republicans on the question of keeping money flowing to the U.S. ally. Senator Mitch McConnell, the longtime Republican leader, has been outspoken over the past year about challenging the isolationist wing of his party that was questioning continued aid to Ukraine. He put his influence and reputation on the line to make the case that it was in the United States’ interest to help a beleaguered democracy trying to beat a Russian invasion led by Vladimir V. Putin, and expressed confidence that his party would join him."
Maine,Q4,"The decision by Senator Joe Manchin III will leave open a seat in a deeply red state, threatening Democrats’ hold on the Senate. Senator Joe Manchin III, the conservative West Virginia Democrat known for bipartisan deal-making and also for frustrating some of his party’s most ambitious policy goals, announced on Thursday that he would not seek re-election, dealing a blow to Democrats’ chances of holding the Senate next year."
Maine,Q4,"Also, Ohio’s governor blocked a ban on transition care for minors. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. Russian forces fired more than 150 missiles and drones into cities across Ukraine today, hitting factories, hospitals and schools in what Ukrainian officials said was the largest air assault since they began tracking them last year."
Maine,Q4,"Also, Eric Adams’s campaign faces corruption questions. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. U.S. employers added 150,000 jobs last month, according to data released today. The number was lower than experts had projected, and it signaled a cooling in the economy, but it remained not far off from the monthly job growth that the U.S. was experiencing before the pandemic."
Maine,Q4,"Stories about the Titan submersible, Matthew Perry and the House Speaker vote were among the most-read of the year. This was the year when many Times readers began to care about artificial intelligence. It was also a year when they wanted their friends and family members to care about the subject."
Maine,Q4,"By splitting money for Israel’s war effort from aid to Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, Speaker Mike Johnson has put the House on a collision course with the Senate and President Biden. Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to force a stand-alone vote on aid for Israel, peeling off a request from the Biden administration for money from Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, has set up a confrontation between the House and Senate over how to fund U.S. allies during the conflicts."
