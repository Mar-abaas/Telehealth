South Carolina,2022,Q3,"The United States is rolling out a reimagined suicide prevention number to address a national mental health crisis.

South Carolina,2022,Q3,"The former mayor will serve as a visiting fellow at institutes focused on health and politics at the university this fall.

Many medical residency programs that are educating the next generation of obstetricians and gynecologists are facing a treacherous choice."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,The commitment comes as the White House and Democrats have been focused on protecting abortion access before the midterm elections.

South Carolina,2022,Q4,"Maxwell Alejandro Frost focused on issues important to many young voters: gun violence, climate change, abortion rights and Medicare for all. Generation Z officially has a seat in Congress."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"R.S.V. has probably peaked, but flu is still surging and Covid-19 cases are rising. Scientists are hopeful next winter will be better. It has become wearyingly routine: Americans are embarking upon yet another holiday travel season in the midst of a viral onslaught."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"Mr. Walker called the report a lie, after The Daily Beast, which has also broken news about Mr. Walker’s out-of-wedlock children, reported that a former girlfriend had the procedure in 2009. ATLANTA — Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia and an avowed abortion opponent, paid for his then-girlfriend to have an abortion in 2009, according to a report published Monday in The Daily Beast. Mr. Walker called the claim “a flat-out lie.”"

For months, the midterm elections appeared to be a clash over rising prices, public safety worries and fears of a looming recession."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"States are turning back into “laboratories of democracy.” There are two constitutional traditions in the United States. The first is the one we all know, tied to Philadelphia and the framers, the Civil War and Reconstruction. It’s the one that structures our political system and fuels some of our most heated conflicts. The second is a little more obscure, despite the fact that it shapes as much of our political life as the first."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"Systems throughout the nation don’t have enough teachers — especially in struggling schools. But there are many ways to address the problem. When Martisha Martin, a history teacher, moved from Broward County, Florida, to Washington, D.C., seven years ago, she chose to work at H.D. Woodson High School on the city’s impoverished eastern edge. She was drawn to the school’s commitment to strengthening urban education — and the prospect of a bigger paycheck."
South Carolina,2023,Q1,"Friends and families are planning reunions; tourists are booking flights. But amid the anticipation, there’s a whiff of anxiety. HONG KONG — Over the past three years, Zhou Wanhui, a Hong Kong resident, has visited her parents in China just three times. Though they live only two hours away by train, Covid restrictions made it so difficult to cross the Hong Kong border into mainland China that one of Ms. Zhou’s trips included a three-hour flight to Shanghai and nearly a month of quarantine in two cities."
South Carolina,2023,Q1,"It is rare for jurors to visit crime scenes, and doing so can be a risk for both the prosecution and defense. Closing arguments were scheduled for later on Wednesday.

South Carolina,2023,Q1,"Their blood is used in a critical test to detect toxins in injectable medicines. We need a synthetic version of that test. Anyone who gets a flu or Covid shot, childhood immunization, heart stent or hip replacement — and that’s almost everyone — is protected from exposure to potentially lethal contaminants known as endotoxins by a test that uses what might seem like an odd ingredient: the blue blood of the horseshoe crab."

South Carolina,2023,Q1,"When Dr. Jenay Powell met Marque Macon at a party in 2018, right away her mother “knew we were going to get married.” Some mothers are met with great consternation when they offer observations about their daughters’ personal lives. Not so for Rhonda Powell."

South Carolina,2023,Q1,"Now that college players are allowed to cut sponsorship deals, some of them are raking in the money — but at what cost to the rest? One day last October, Bubba Cunningham, the athletic director at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, made the short walk from his office to the Dean E. Smith Center, where the men’s basketball team was holding a noon practice, and took a seat at one end of the stands. He wanted to see how the Tar Heels were coming together for the upcoming season, though he already had an idea: The Associated Press ranked them first in the nation in its preseason poll. Cunningham watched the starters run plays against imaginary defenses. Most of those plays ended with a guard, either Caleb Love or R.J. Davis, making a bounce pass to Armando Bacot, who laid the ball into the basket."
South Carolina,2023,Q1,"Four states could ban transition care into young adulthood. Lawmakers in several others want to restrict drag shows in ways that could affect transgender performers broadly. It’s part of a long-term plan. Over the past three years, Republican state lawmakers have put forward a barrage of bills to regulate the lives of transgender youths, restricting the sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and medical care they can receive."
South Carolina,2023,Q1,"Arriving in record numbers, they’re ending up in dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws — including in factories that make products for well-known brands like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom. It was almost midnight in Grand Rapids, Mich., but inside the factory everything was bright. A conveyor belt carried bags of Cheerios past a cluster of young workers. One was 15-year-old Carolina Yoc, who came to the United States on her own last year to live with a relative she had never met."
South Carolina,2023,Q1,"The court’s opinion is not the final word on the case, but it upheld a lower court’s decision to suspend the state’s abortion ban. North Dakota’s Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s decision to block a ban on abortions in the state, and said the state Constitution protects abortion rights in some situations."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"After the G.O.P.-led legislature passed a 12-week ban, the Democratic governor vetoed the bill. The Republicans could override it, if all their members stay unified.  North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, now in the waning years of his second term, has suddenly found himself back on a campaign trail."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Friday’s victory by the United Steelworkers at a factory building electric school buses was a test for Democratic hopes that clean-energy funding from Washington could bolster organized labor. Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Focusing heavily on Florida at his first town-hall event in the Granite State, Ron DeSantis drew a reception that was sometimes warm, sometimes more skeptical — especially on the issue of abortion.

Ron DeSantis of Florida talked on Tuesday about illegal immigration in Texas, crime in Chicago, disorder on the streets of San Francisco and the wonders of nearly every aspect of Florida — a state he mentioned about 80 times."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The 76-year-old performer canceled a Saturday performance in Charleston, S.C., for unspecified health reasons. He had resumed touring this year after canceling a series of shows in October.

South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Mr. Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina weighing a 2024 bid, told a questioner that the president deserves to be criticized on his policies, not his age. During a town hall on Monday at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina received a question about President Biden’s fitness for office, putting his stated desire to run a positive campaign to the test. Mr. Scott, who is expected to formally begin his presidential campaign at the end of the month, offered an answer that criticized Mr. Biden on the merits of his leadership, rather than his age or mental fitness."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The former South Carolina governor, who also served as United Nations ambassador under Donald Trump, emphasized her experience and vision. Will it be enough for her to stand out? Nikki Haley, who was the first prominent Republican to announce a challenge to former President Donald J. Trump in the 2024 race, has yet to see her presidential campaign catch fire. On Sunday night, she had a fresh opportunity to make the case for her candidacy during a 90-minute CNN town hall in prime time, in an effort to emerge from the low single digits in polls where she has been mired."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The presidential candidate went on the daytime talk show to debate his views about systemic racism. But it was his comments about L.G.B.T.Q. rights that got boos from the audience. The chatty daytime talk show “The View” might seem like an unlikely platform for Tim Scott, a senator from South Carolina and a presidential candidate, to get his footing with Republican primary voters, but he saw an opening on Monday and tried to make the most of it."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The court split 3-3 on whether to revive a much stricter six-week limit, enacted in 2018, that was struck down before Roe v. Wade was overturned. A legal attempt to ban abortion in Iowa after six weeks of pregnancy failed on Friday, after the State Supreme Court deadlocked over whether to vacate a lower court’s injunction and allow the ban to take effect. That means abortion will remain legal in Iowa through 20 weeks of pregnancy."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors. Ten states in the past three months have passed laws prohibiting what is known as gender-affirming care for young people, in a rapid effort by Republican lawmakers across the country."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Mrs. Clinton cited Republican obstruction, not Ms. Feinstein’s health: Republicans would refuse to let Democrats fill her seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, she said, preventing judicial confirmations. Hillary Clinton weighed in this week on a question that has occupied Senate Democrats and much of the party at large for months: whether Senator Dianne Feinstein of California should resign in light of mounting health problems that have made it difficult for her to do her job."

South Carolina,2023,Q3,"In her stump speech, the former governor calls for common sense and experience in the White House, leaving crowds wanting more.

South Carolina,2023,Q3,"After a standout college career at the University of Tennessee, she won two Olympic gold medals, played nine years in the W.N.B.A. and was the head coach at two universities. Nikki McCray-Penson, an all-American point guard for the powerhouse University of Tennessee women’s basketball team, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a three-time All-Star in the W.N.B.A., died on Friday. She was 51."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"The Florida governor has so far found little success in getting his criticism of the Trump administration’s Covid-19 policies to stick, but that has not stopped him from trying. Gov. Ron DeSantis  had hoped that his response to the coronavirus pandemic, which helped propel him to a resounding re-election in Florida last year, would produce similar results in the Republican presidential primary."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"Win or lose, Nikki Haley knows how to run. A long time ago in South Carolina, as Nikki Haley recalls when she talks to voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, she ran campaigns that nobody thought much of until, unexpectedly, suddenly, she was winning them.

South Carolina,2023,Q4,"As they vie to be the race’s Trump alternative, the two Republican rivals have been trading barbs, zeroing in on each other’s response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Once distant rivals in the 2024 presidential race, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are now locked in a heated battle to become the most viable Republican alternative to former President Donald J. Trump, seizing on the Israel-Hamas conflict to hurl broadsides at each other."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"More tenants than ever spend half or more of their income for shelter, leaving less for everything else, taking an emotional toll and leaving some without a place to call their own. To understand how rising rents punish families of modest means, look no further than the queen-size bed that Jessica Jones and her three children share in her mother’s living room, where each night brings a squirming, turning tussle for space in a house with no privacy."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"The five candidates at the third debate rejected calls for Israel to rein in its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack.

South Dakota,2020,Q1,"Her transition has been documented in the public eye for more than a decade. The newest season of her reality show began this week. Jazz Jennings has been in the spotlight since 2007, when she was 6 and appeared on the ABC News program “20/20.” Wearing a dress, she opened up to Barbara Walters about being a transgender child, at a time when mainstream audiences didn’t often hear from those voices."
South Dakota,2020,Q1,"Two House Democrats joined them in signing a legal brief in a case that is certain to inject the divisive politics of abortion into the 2020 presidential race. WASHINGTON — More than 200 Republican members of Congress on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to consider overturning Roe v.

South Dakota,2020,Q1,"Better still: Lawmakers in so-called flyover states are leading the charge. As a national advocate for a nonprofit organization working to protect the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. youth in America, I spend a lot of time looking down on wheat fields from tens of thousands of feet in the air. The constant flights from coast to coast and state capital to state capital give me plenty of time to reflect on the world in which today’s L.G.B.T.Q. young people are growing up."

South Dakota,2020,Q1,"The president insisted he has used the Defense Production Act, but said at a briefing that “we are literally being besieged” by companies “that want to do the work and help our country.” WASHINGTON — President Trump and his advisers have resisted calls from congressional Democrats and a growing number of governors to use a federal law that would mobilize industry and provide badly needed resources against the coronavirus spread, days after the president said he would consider using that authority."
South Dakota,2020,Q1,"The outbreak of the virus has sickened more than 80 million people. At least 1.7 million people have died. Here’s how the year unfolded.

The virus has killed more than 1.6 million and sickened more than 76 million over the last year. The World Health Organization has declared the situation a global pandemic."

He has been a part of the national team in the duathlon and the triathlon six times, and he is the first transgender athlete sponsored by Nike."
South Dakota,2020,Q2,"Almost every movie reminds Trump of … something it’s not. In troubled times we often find some great book, or work of art, or film that helps put everything in context. And I’m a little worried that right now for Donald Trump it’s “Mutiny on the Bounty.”"
South Dakota,2020,Q2,"Disruptions are expected in the production and distribution of products like pork, and localized shortages could occur. The nation’s food supply chain is showing signs of strain, as increasing numbers of workers are falling ill with the coronavirus in meat processing plants, warehouses and grocery stores."
South Dakota,2020,Q2,"Dozens of tracking apps for smartphones are being used or developed to help contain the coronavirus pandemic. But there are worries about privacy and hastily written software. Faced with a growing coronavirus threat, the governor of North Dakota last month posed a question to a friend from his private-sector days. The friend, a software engineer, had once created a location-tracking app for football fans at North Dakota State University who liked to meet up when traveling to big games."

South Dakota,2020,Q2,"To reopen safely, companies need good, clear and mandatory guidelines, not immunity from liability. There’s a tension at the heart of all of the plans to reopen the country in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic: The economy needs Americans to get back to work, but workplaces need employees and customers to feel that coming back won’t endanger their health or their lives."
South Dakota,2020,Q2,"A relatively small number of plants process much of the beef and pork in the United States, and some of them have closed because workers are getting sick. The modern American slaughterhouse is a very different place from the one that Upton Sinclair depicted in his early-20th-century novel, “The Jungle.”"

Wade Has the Biggest Effect.” Written by the journalists Margot Sanger-Katz, Claire Cain Miller and Quoctrung Bui, the article examined what would happen if Roe v.

South Dakota,2023,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."

Doug Burgum of North Dakota mingled with families who were digging into eggs, sausage and pancakes at a Fourth of July breakfast hosted by the local Rotary Club."
South Dakota,2023,Q4,"Post-Roe voting might bring America to a new consensus — but only if the voters keep getting their say. As long as the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v.

Tennessee,2020,Q1,"The outbreak at Life Care in Kirkland, Wash., has left 7 people dead so far. Now the government is focusing all inspections at nursing homes on infection prevention.

Tennessee,2020,Q2,"A Democratic measure would cap insurance costs and grant the government the power to negotiate drug costs just as the coronavirus pandemic renews concerns over prices.

Tennessee,2020,Q3,"The answer largely depends on whether Medicare and private health insurers will adequately cover virtual doctor visits once coronavirus outbreaks subside. Telemedicine is having its moment. Over the last few months, millions of people have relied on video or telephone calls to talk to their doctors. But as the pandemic moves across the United States, and eventually recedes in some places, how long will the moment last?"
Tennessee,2020,Q3,"Schools may not reopen, and the “holiday” cuts into government revenue. But during a pandemic, states may be thinking, why not offer a bit of relief?

Tennessee,2020,Q3,"If medical rationing becomes necessary, some older adults are prepared to step aside. But many have the opposite concern: that they will be arbitrarily sent to the rear of the line. In April, as the coronavirus was rampaging through the Northeast, Larry Churchill considered what he would do if the pandemic caused medical shortages. Should he, a 75-year-old, direct care to younger people before him if he got sick?"
Tennessee,2020,Q3,Thousands of cases have already been linked to schools this season. But a lack of reporting means that a national accounting remains out of reach. Thousands of cases have already been linked to schools this season. But a lack of reporting means that a national accounting remains out of reach.

Tennessee,2020,Q4,"While such treatments are promising, their use has been slowed by testing lags, overwhelmed hospitals and a perception the therapies are only for well-connected people.

Tennessee,2020,Q4,"The league introduced new measures, including video surveillance to monitor the wearing of masks while in team facilities or traveling, after postponing games because of an outbreak.

Tennessee,2021,Q1,"The industry lacks randomized controlled clinical trials that can clearly establish benefits and risks. Dan Shapiro was the first person I knew to use medical marijuana. As a junior at Vassar College in 1987, he was being treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma with potent chemotherapy that caused severe nausea and vomiting.

Tennessee,2021,Q1,"The usual elites are still great, but the rest of the college field has a real shot to win the championship this year. Star power isn’t concentrated at the top anymore. There are few more compelling diversions than N.C.A.A. tournament basketball, and after the postseason was canceled last March because of the coronavirus pandemic, plenty of the best players in women’s basketball are hungry for the bright lights of the big stage. Their passion for the game will, at least for the next few weeks, become our own as we become immersed in the bracket’s glories and heartbreaks."

NASHVILLE — It’s hard for me to describe the utter rage that filled me when I opened my local newspaper last Tuesday and saw The Tennessean’s lead article: “Vaccinated Lose Access to Treatment,” the headline read. What new through-the-looking-glass madness was afoot in this Covid-beleaguered leadership vacuum?"
Tennessee,2021,Q4,"The committee is chaired by Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who ripped President Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Nicholas Burns, President Biden’s picks for ambassadorial posts in Japan and China faced a wilder ride."
Tennessee,2021,Q4,"For me the solstice has always been a promise: After tomorrow, there will be more light. NASHVILLE — “More light!” the German poet Goethe famously called out on his deathbed. This is a rather loose translation of his actual final words — “Open the second shutter so that more light may come in” — but never mind that. After the year we’ve just endured, we recognize Goethe’s urgency. Feeling the darkness descend, we beg for more light."

The F.B.I. agents spent nearly two years tailing the professor, following him to work, to the grocery store, and even keeping his college-age son under surveillance. They told the university where he held a tenured position that he was a Chinese operative, prompting the school to cooperate with their investigation and later fire him."

Tennessee,2021,Q4,"Meyer won three college football national titles but lasted 13 games in the N.F.L., where his short tenure in Jacksonville was marred by questionable conduct on and off the field. Just 11 months ago, coming off another pitiful season, the Jacksonville Jaguars found themselves in one of the more enviable situations in the N.F.L."
Tennessee,2021,Q4,"An inexpensive blood test can warn couples if they face one in four odds of having a baby with the disease. No one ever told Lametra Scott and Rickey Buggs about it. No doctor ever counseled Lametra Scott and her husband, Rickey Buggs, to get a simple blood test that would have warned them they each carried a mutated gene that — if inherited from both — would cause sickle cell disease in their baby."
Tennessee,2021,Q4,"Focusing on external sights and sounds, rather than what’s going on in your body, made running feel easier and improved performance. To make running seem easier, try paying attention to anything other than your body. That’s according to a fascinating new study of the ways in which how we focus as we move can affect how we feel as we move. The study was small and involved novice female runners, but the findings suggest that the more closely runners listen to their bodies, the more draining their running can become, both physically and psychologically. Conversely, the more runners distract themselves from what their bodies are doing as they put one foot in front of the other, the more effortless their run may feel, and the better their performance.

Tennessee,2022,Q1,"Even as the medical community grapples with how best to provide care to transgender adolescents, some states seek to ban it outright. FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — For years, Zara Banks had been looking forward to her 14th birthday — the moment, last June, when her life would no longer be on pause."
Tennessee,2022,Q1,"Senator Rand Paul and other Republicans are lionizing The Big Board, a family-owned bar a mile from the U.S. Capitol. Days before the first phase of Washington’s vaccination entry requirement went into effect on Jan. 15, The Big Board, a family-owned bar in the popular H Street Corridor, tweeted that it would “always” be open to everyone."

Tennessee,2022,Q1,"U.S. service members and veterans have long insisted that the military’s garbage-disposal fires in war zones made them ill. Why were their claims stonewalled for so long? The soldiers with inexplicable breathing complaints started appearing in Dr. Robert F. Miller’s pulmonology clinic in 2004, the year after Baghdad fell to invading United States forces. These new patients were active-duty troops from nearby Fort Campbell, men and women who came home from war with mysterious respiratory ailments. The base asked Miller, an unassuming and soft-spoken lung specialist at Vanderbilt University, to take a look."

Tennessee,2022,Q2,"In his new book, “Truly, Madly,” Stephen Galloway looks at the tumultuous, star-crossed marriage of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. In case you thought rocky celebrity unions (and public obsession with them) were a contemporary phenomenon, Stephen Galloway’s best-selling book about the marriage of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh will tell you otherwise."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"Jackson Women’s Health has seen an increase in patients, many from states like Texas and Louisiana that have restricted access to abortions. The morning after the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion in a case concerning Mississippi’s only abortion provider, ​​Derenda Hancock arrived at the clinic around sunrise, just as she does most days, to lead a group of volunteers escorting patients. Wednesday morning, the group was back to do it again."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"A meeting of the committee underscored how many uncertainties lie ahead, including whether a vaccine that works better against variants can be ready by fall. WASHINGTON — Researchers trying to devise an updated coronavirus vaccine for use this fall would have to settle on a formula as early as June to meet that deadline, federal officials said on Wednesday, even though some clinical trials are just now getting underway."

Tennessee,2022,Q2,Most states likely to outlaw abortions allow for exceptions to save a mother’s life. But many women and doctors ask: Where will lawmakers draw the line? Follow our live updates on the latest abortion news and the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"The actress Ashley Judd said in a television interview on Thursday that her mother was suffering from mental illness when she died last month. When Naomi Judd, the Grammy-winning country music singer, died last month, her daughter Ashley Judd said that she had lost her mother to the “disease of mental illness.” On Thursday, Ms. Judd was more candid, saying in a television interview that her mother had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at her home in Tennessee, and encouraging people who are distressed to seek help."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"The same rationale could also be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception, same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, laid out a vision that prompted concerns about what other rights could disappear: The same rationale that the Supreme Court used to declare there was no right to abortion, he said, should also be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception, same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"Hannah Margaret Allen and Grant Schumacher chose to marry at her family’s funeral home, where “there’s a lot of life and energy,” said the groom. When Hannah Margaret Allen and Grant Joseph Schumacher met for drinks on June 7, 2019, it was his first time going on a date with someone he had met online. Ms. Allen, by her approximation, had done so 50 times by then."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"You may still be able to reduce your tax bill by contributing to an I.R.A., for instance. And if you have questions, the I.R.S. is offering free walk-in help on Saturday. After two years of extended deadlines, tax filing in April is back — and fast approaching."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"Many of the millions of women who live in these states would be able to seek legal abortions elsewhere, but the barriers to access may be hard for some to overcome. Many of the millions of women who live in these states would be able to seek legal abortions elsewhere, but the barriers to access may be hard for some to overcome."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"The new vaccine campaign is one of the country’s last remaining strategies, as masks have fallen away and quarantines have diminished. So far, the rollout is methodical but muted. It was vaccination time at Ethel Brown’s long-term care home in the Bronx. Again. Ms. Brown, 95, had already gotten four Covid shots, and while she was happy to submit to a fifth, this latest booster prompted a few questions."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Neither piece of legislation has the votes to advance in the Senate, but Democrats intend them to draw clear lines on the issue for the midterm elections. WASHINGTON — The House on Friday passed two bills aiming at ensuring access to abortion in the post-Roe era, as Democrats seek to draw clear distinctions with Republicans on the issue heading into the midterm election campaign."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Trevon Murphy, 40, who a cousin said had a history of mental illness, was spotted by a correction officer near a Harlem park. A 40-year-old homeless man was arrested Wednesday on murder and attempted murder charges in the stabbings of three homeless men in Manhattan, one fatally, the police said. The men were all sleeping outdoors when attacked over the course of the last week."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"I could not help my mother, Naomi Judd, who lost a long battle against mental illness. I can, however, do something about how she is remembered.  April 30, 2022, was the most shattering day of my life. My beloved mother, Naomi Judd, who had come to believe that her mental illness would only get worse, never better, took her own life that day. The trauma of discovering and then holding her laboring body haunts my nights. As my family and I continue to mourn our loss, the rampant and cruel misinformation that has spread about her death, and about our relationships with her, stalks my days. The horror of it will only worsen if the details surrounding her death are disclosed by the Tennessee law that generally allows police reports, including family interviews, from closed investigations to be made public."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Even in some states where abortion remains legal, wait times for appointments are long because of increased demand. The reversal of Roe v. Wade did not affect the legal status of abortion in New Mexico, where seven clinics are still operating. But that does not mean an abortion is easy to obtain there."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Unprecedented federal aid could help schools dig out of pandemic problems — if they can figure out how to spend it in time. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, school superintendents and educators have faced impossible demands as state directives bounced between in-person and remote learning, with schools closing and opening week by week and often day by day. Once teachers’ unions, politicians and public-health advocates finally came to terms with the decision to reopen schools in the fall of 2021, battle lines shifted to whether in-person learning would require vaccinations and masks. Over the course of that school year, 18 states and the District of Columbia issued mask mandates, while 11 tried to institute bans. At least one state, Virginia, did both: Last fall, it required masks in school; by the spring, it banned requiring them. "
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"As combat sports grow in popularity, ringside physicians grapple with the precarious ethics of their role. CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — Late one Saturday evening in June, two men in their 20s stood across from each other, shirtless and swaying, in a mixed martial arts cage in Exhibit Hall B of the Chattanooga Convention Center. The mat was sticky, a dark canvas of blood and foot sweat. Something in the combatants’ eyes made them look both terrifying and terrified, wolflike and rabbitlike at once."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Voters in the Detroit suburbs said issues including the economy and bodily autonomy were driving their ballot decisions. HAZEL PARK, Mich. — Ashley Polansky, a 34-year-old retail manager, hurried inside a polling place at a tiny church to vote on Tuesday morning with one issue foremost in her mind."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Corporal punishment had been in a slow decline before the pandemic, but remains legal in 19 states, mostly in the South. The practice makes children more aggressive and disruptive, researchers say. A Missouri school district’s announcement that it is bringing back paddling drew a lot of attention and dismay this week. But corporal punishment — with an interruption, perhaps, for the coronavirus pandemic in some places — never went away in a large number of schools."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"The tentative deal would close an investigation by nearly three dozen states into the company’s marketing and sales practices. Juul Labs, fighting for its survival in the United States, on Tuesday tentatively agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen states over marketing and sales practices that they contend set off the nation’s teenage vaping crisis."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Vote because abortion matters. Despite Republican‌ assurances that their draconian abortion bans wouldn’t hurt women, a flood of heart-wrenching accounts from across the country prove otherwise. Yet even with that outpouring of stories, plus polls showing broad opposition to the bans and an increase in women registering to vote, it’s still unclear if the issue will be the deciding factor for voters in the midterm elections on Tuesday."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Machines that examine samples of drugs can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, but experts say they are an increasingly vital tool in stemming overdoses. CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The white powder, deposited in a small tube, arrived one morning by FedEx in a basement office on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,Proponents say the ability to check drugs for the presence of lethal fentanyl may save lives. But critics say the strips enable drug use. “You smoke weed?” Eufamia Lopez asked the half-dozen young men lounging on benches in a public housing courtyard in the South Bronx.
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Canine influenza can spread quickly through shelters, kennels and day care facilities, although most dogs will recover on their own, experts said. When a few dogs started coughing at a Texas animal shelter in October, veterinarians were not initially alarmed. The shelter, Operation Kindness, had seen its share of sick dogs."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"The trial, the first over a challenge to a state ban on gender-affirming care, concluded last week; the judge has not indicated when he will rule. LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — For Dylan Brandt, a transgender teenager in Arkansas, two years on testosterone has meant that “my outside finally matches the way I feel on the inside.”"
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Ascension, one of the country’s largest health systems, spent years cutting jobs, leaving it flat-footed when the pandemic hit. At a hospital in a Chicago suburb last winter, there were so few nurses that psychiatric patients with Covid were left waiting a full day for beds, and a single aide was on hand to assist with 32 infected patients. Nurses were so distraught about the inadequate staffing that they banded together to file formal complaints every day for more than a month."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"After Roe fell, a sleepy college town in Southern Illinois found itself to be a crucial destination for abortion access. Not all of its residents are happy about it. CARBONDALE, Ill. — There had never been an abortion clinic in the quiet college town of Carbondale, Ill. So when its first clinic opened this fall, it revealed tensions between residents that had largely been hidden."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"The Texas Public Policy Foundation is shaping laws, running influence campaigns and taking legal action in a bid to promote fossil fuels. When a lawsuit was filed to block the nation’s first major offshore wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, it appeared to be a straightforward clash between those who earn their living from the sea and others who would install turbines and underwater cables that could interfere with the harvesting of squid, fluke and other fish."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"It’s New York City. No one is here to be subtle. Here’s what some runners wore for the city’s largest block party. Before 50,000 runners are unleashed onto the streets of New York, they congregate in Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island and face an hourslong wait. In those early hours, marathon runners linger, grapple with pre-race jitters and admire what others are wearing."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Government oversight of sports betting offers scant consumer protections and looks to the industry to police itself, The Times found. David Hummel placed his first sports bet in January 2021, wagering $250 on the underdog in a mixed-martial-arts fight. He won $662.50, he said, “and it was probably the worst thing that could have happened to me.”"
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"Jenna Ortega hosted an episode that featured appearances by Fred Armisen and also took aim at Tucker Carlson and a Tennessee politician with questionable Instagram habits. There was a time — say, just before a certain incident near the end of last year’s Academy Awards show — when the ceremony itself was a dignified proceeding and the embarrassment was largely confined to the preshow red carpet program."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"The board that regulates emergency medical technicians in Tennessee on Friday voted to suspend the licenses of the two E.M.T.s who arrived at the scene and failed to render aid. The two emergency medical technicians who first arrived to treat Tyre Nichols after he was severely beaten by Memphis police officers did not provide any care for 19 minutes after getting to the scene, a regulatory agency concluded on Friday as it voted to suspend their licenses."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"Hody Childress brought cash every month to a pharmacist in Alabama, asking her to use it to help people buy medicine. The town learned of the arrangement only after his death. When the doctor saw what a hornet sting had done to Eli Schlageter, 15, causing his mouth and throat to swell, his advice to Eli’s parents was unequivocal: Get an EpiPen."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"Trans liberation is a gift to everyone because it expands the categories for what it means to be human. I’m not a detail-oriented person. My clothes are usually rumpled; when I write, I rarely dot every i or cross each t (either literally or metaphorically). But when I am officiating at a funeral, I meticulously study each letter of the name of the person who died — especially when I’m leading a memorial service for a transgender or nonbinary person. Our names are so often disrespected in life, let alone death."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"The issue is no longer a political hammer for the right. In decades past, as the calendar turned to January, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade would come into view. Abortion opponents would be planning to acknowledge the date with the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. Supporters of abortion rights would schedule seminars or meet for quiet conversations about whether and when the Supreme Court might actually go so far as to repudiate the decision it issued 50 years ago on Jan. 22, 1973."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"Five articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"The state, which is near others with abortion bans and restrictions, has had a 37 percent rise in abortions since the constitutional right to abortion was overturned. RALEIGH, N.C. — Clinic by clinic, county by county and up to the highest levels of state government, no state embodies the nation’s post-Roe upheaval like North Carolina."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"Many of the legal arguments seeking to overturn abortion bans rely on rights provided by the states, and how they are interpreted by state supreme courts. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in June, it declared that it was sending the issue back to the “people and their elected representatives.” But the fight has largely moved to a different set of supreme courts and constitutions: those in the states."
Tennessee,2023,Q1,"The final season of the drama series “Snowfall” airs on FX, and the 54th annual N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards are live on BET. Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Feb. 20-26. Details and times are subject to change."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Corrections that appeared in print on Tuesday, June 6, 2023. An article on Friday about the only Black participant in the first national spelling bee competition referred incorrectly to Zaila Avant-garde. She was the first Black American to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee, not the first Black student to do so. (Jody-Anne Maxwell of Jamaica won the bee in 1998.)"
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Critics say a fierce law-and-order approach could undermine public health goals and advances in addiction treatment. Three teenage girls were found slumped in a car in the parking lot of a rural Tennessee high school last month, hours before graduation ceremonies. Two were dead from fentanyl overdoses. The third, a 17-year-old, was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Two days later, she was charged with the girls’ murders."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"We are honoring the Top 11 winners of our Student Editorial Contest by publishing their essays. This one is by Callisto Lim, age 16.

Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Temperatures will be up to 20 degrees above normal for much of the region through at least the weekend, with no nighttime relief. Even for Southerners used to spending a lot of time outside, this week’s brutal heat and humidity — which spread from Texas across the Gulf Coast and north into Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas on Wednesday — are a little much."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"The key to a successful legal campaign is realizing that gender freedom benefits everyone. Transgender Americans are under attack. Across the country, Republicans have introduced an avalanche of legislation to restrict access to gender-affirming health care, censor how gender is discussed in schools, prevent trans people from using public bathrooms and even ban drag shows and cross-dressing onstage. In March, Tennessee criminalized drag performances where children are present. In April, Montana Republicans barred Representative Zooey Zephyr from the floor of the state House in part for her vocal opposition to a similar bill, which is now headed to the governor’s desk."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"The league suspended Isaiah Rodgers and Rashod Berry of the Indianapolis Colts and Demetrius Taylor, a free agent, for at least a full season. A fourth player received a six-game penalty for betting on other sports. The N.F.L. announced penalties on Thursday for four players who had violated the league’s gambling rules."

Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Some doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are fleeing restrictive abortion laws. Idaho has been particularly hard hit. One by one, doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are disappearing from Idaho — part of a wave of obstetricians fleeing restrictive abortion laws and a hostile state legislature. Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, a family doctor who also delivers babies in the tiny mountain town of McCall, is among those left behind, facing a lonely and uncertain future."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"So far, 24 states have eliminated sales taxes on period products that have been criticized as discriminatory. On Friday, a bipartisan Texas bill that eliminates sales taxes on menstrual products went into effect, making it the 24th state in the country, as well as District of Columbia, to remove what is colloquially known as the “tampon tax.”"
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Cases of severe black lung disease are back to the highest level in decades. It’s totally preventable. As a high school baseball star, Denver Hoskins led Kentucky in home runs and was invited to try out for the Cincinnati Reds. But when his father got sick (and later died) from black lung, a disease caused by inhaling mineral dust, the younger Mr. Hoskins gave up his Division I college scholarship offer to support his family. Following in his father’s footsteps, he went to work as a coal miner. By the age of 44, Mr. Hoskins was diagnosed with his own case of the most severe form of black lung. He now breathes from an oxygen tank at night and watches his son’s batting practice from the sidelines."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Gershun Freeman, 33, died last year after being stomped, punched and pinned down by the deputies in Shelby County, Tenn., his family’s lawyer said. Nine sheriff’s deputies in Memphis have been indicted in the death of a man with mental health problems who died in custody last fall after being stomped, punched and pinned down. It is the latest case to draw attention to how law enforcement responds to people in mental distress."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"With a throttle and no pedals, Super73’s new “electric balance bike” blurs the lines of regulation and safety. “No license, registration or insurance required,” its marketing promises. LeGrand Crewse, co-founder and chief executive of Super73, recently showed off the company’s latest product, a diminutive motorized bike called the K1D. Aimed at riders 4 years old and up, the vehicle lacks pedals, in the spirit of a training bicycle, and has a throttle. The company calls the K1D an “electric balance bike.”"
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"A Georgia judge who had temporarily blocked the ban put her ruling on hold after a federal court struck down an injunction on a similar law in Alabama. A federal judge in Georgia has allowed the state’s ban on gender transition care for minors to go back into full effect, after a federal appeals court panel allowed a similar law in Alabama to be enforced. Before the appellate ruling, the same judge, Sarah Geraghty, had granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked part of the Georgia ban."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Surprisingly tricky questions about an increasingly popular vehicle. E-bikes are increasingly visible on roads and bicycle paths, with a growing number of teenagers among the riders. But the recent deaths of several teenage riders have raised concerns about the safety of some types of vehicles, and about whether they legally qualify as e-bikes. Here’s what’s known about e-bikes and their risks."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Here is a look at five expansive searches that lasted weeks, months or even years before the authorities caught their targets. For more than a week, Danelo Cavalcante, a Brazilian national who was convicted of murder in suburban Philadelphia and then escaped from prison, has eluded an intense manhunt that has grown to hundreds of law enforcement officers."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"The state’s highest court declined to stop a new law banning transition care for transgender minors from taking effect as legal challenges proceed. The Texas Supreme Court allowed a new law banning transition care for transgender minors to go into effect on Friday, halting a range of medically-accepted treatments, including hormones and puberty blockers, in the nation’s most populous Republican-led state."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"In a ruling, a federal judge temporarily blocked the part of the law that would have banned hormone replacement therapy for people under 18. A federal judge in Georgia has temporarily blocked part of a state law that prohibits hormone replacement therapy for transgender minors. The preliminary injunction was issued by Judge Sarah E. Geraghty of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Georgia on Sunday, more than a month after the ban took effect."

Tennessee,2023,Q4,"More than half of House Democrats declined to back the Republican-written resolution, as some argued that equating criticism of the state of Israel with hatred of the Jewish people went too far. House Democrats splintered on Tuesday over a resolution condemning the rise of antisemitism in the United States and around the world, with more than half of them declining to support a measure declaring that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism.”"
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of the bill, which also prohibited transgender girls and women from sports teams that correspond with their gender identity, is a rare move by a Republican governor. Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, vetoed a bill on Friday that would have barred transgender minors from receiving puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries, a rare rejection in what has been a concerted effort by the Republican Party to mobilize cultural conservatives around transgender issues for the 2024 primaries."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"After losing in statehouses, supporters of transgender rights filed lawsuits in at least 14 states to convince judges that transition care for minors was safe. When the summer started, transgender-rights supporters were riding a courtroom winning streak."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"Each year, we ask teenagers to send us their application essays about work, money or social class. Here are four, from California to Cambodia. Some of the most basic questions about money are also central to figuring out what and who you want to be: What do I have, what do I want, how does that compare to others around me and how should I feel about it?"
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"People with the genetic disease have new opportunities to eliminate their symptoms, but the treatments come with obstacles that limit their reach. On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first gene editing therapy ever to be used in humans, for sickle cell disease, a debilitating blood disorder caused by a single mutated gene."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,Pressure builds for a pause in Gaza. The leaders of the 27 E.U. nations called yesterday for a break in the fighting in Gaza to address a dire humanitarian crisis inside the territory. Their statement came hours after the Israeli military said it had briefly sent tanks into Gaza in preparation for the next stage of fighting.
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"Some lawyers say the changes could make it more difficult to bring legal action against the company. Parents, schools and even attorneys general have increasingly been raising concerns about how TikTok may be hooking children to the app and serving them inappropriate content. But some lawyers say bringing legal action against the company could be more difficult after TikTok quietly changed its U.S. terms of service this summer."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"A number of skirmishes unfolded in Congress as tempers flared ahead of a government shutdown deadline and Thanksgiving holiday break. The former G.O.P. speaker elbowed one of the Republicans who had voted to oust him. A Republican senator rose to challenge an organized labor leader to a brawl during a hearing. Across the Capitol, the chairman of a different panel compared a member of his committee to a cartoon character."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"A selection of stories that Times editors thought deserved more readers. Before the internet, there was no way for New York Times editors to know how many people had read an article.

Texas,2022,Q2,"Since the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, his hometown, Mr. O’Rourke has pushed for stricter gun safety. It hasn’t helped him politically — but that’s not his point. DALLAS — To loud cheers in a community gym on Wednesday evening, Beto O’Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso and the Democratic candidate for governor of Texas, renewed his criticism of Gov. Greg Abbott over the state’s gun laws, which he said allowed an 18-year-old in Uvalde to slaughter 19 students and two teachers with a legally and easily acquired military-style weapon."

Texas,2022,Q2,"Online hoax allegations are an insult to family members and should be taken down. It’s almost impossible to comprehend what to do in the wake of mass shootings like the one that killed 19 schoolchildren and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, this week. While there are lots of words — you can listen to my discussion on “Sway” with Nicholas Kristof and Frank Smyth on where we go next on gun control — it can leave an empty feeling, as the sense of hopelessness overwhelms our ability to understand how we got here. The problem is exacerbated by the perpetrators’ use of online tools, which some have used to float phony conspiracy theories."
Texas,2022,Q2,"Under a public health rule known as Title 42, thousands of migrants have been expelled at the border. A federal judge is halting efforts to begin lifting the policy, due to end on May 23. A federal judge on Monday said he would block the Biden administration from exempting migrants from expulsion under a Trump-era public health order until the policy is officially lifted next month."
Texas,2022,Q2,"Mass shootings and other types of trauma can have ripple effects not only for survivors but also for those who follow the news of the events. Heather Martin was a senior at Columbine High School in 1999 when two gunmen, also teenagers, killed 13 people and wounded 21 more before taking their own lives. She ended up barricaded in a room for three hours. And although she wasn’t physically injured, she witnessed the aftermath of the shooting, which she described as “horrifying.”"

Texas,2022,Q3,"Lever Alejos, who was delivered to the nation’s capital courtesy of Gov. Greg Abbott, has found plenty of work. ‘I feel fortunate the governor put me on a bus to Washington.’ When Lever Alejos of Venezuela arrived at the southern border penniless in July, he gladly accepted a free bus ride to Washington, D.C., courtesy of the state of Texas. He had no family or friends to receive him, and spent one night in the plaza across from Union Station. He soon settled into a homeless shelter."
Texas,2022,Q3,"Such infections are rare. From 2012 to 2021, only 31 cases were reported in the U.S., according to federal data. An infection caused by a brain-eating amoeba killed a child who swam in a Nebraska river over the weekend, health officials said Friday. It was the first such death in the state’s history and the second in the Midwest this summer."

Greg Abbott, the Republican incumbent, in the tightening contest."
Texas,2022,Q3,"Texas has been hit with an unrelenting heat wave. Nowhere is it more miserable than in low-income areas that have less access to shade and air-conditioning. SAN ANTONIO — One day last week, Juanita Cruz-Perez poked her head out the back door of her two-bedroom home in San Antonio and shook her head no. It wasn’t quite noon yet, and the heat was already unbearable. She opened the front and back doors, praying for any kind of breeze, and turned on a plastic fan that sputtered hot air. She resisted the temptation to turn on the power-guzzling air-conditioner."
Texas,2022,Q3,"The National Health Service is closing England’s sole youth gender clinic, which had been criticized for long wait times and inadequate services. The National Health Service in England announced on Thursday that it was shutting down the country’s only youth gender clinic in favor of a more distributed and comprehensive network of medical care for adolescents seeking hormones and other gender treatments."
Texas,2022,Q3,"The preliminary injunction was a limited but significant victory for the Biden administration after the Justice Department sued Idaho this month.

Wade in June."
Texas,2022,Q4,"The play’s author, who is Black, said he crafted its language to be historically accurate in representing civil rights struggles. But the theater program at the university heeded the call of students. Texas Wesleyan University halted its production of “Down In Mississippi,” a play about registering voters in the 1960s, after criticism from students who said racist epithets in the script could contribute to a hostile, unwelcoming environment. Its author said he was using that language to represent the reality of the period."
Texas,2022,Q4,About 130 migrants from Texas were bused to the vice president’s home on one of the coldest Christmas Eves on record in the nation’s capital. Dec. 26: This article was updated with a statement from the office of Governor Greg Abbott of Texas.
Texas,2022,Q4,"The Texas Public Policy Foundation is shaping laws, running influence campaigns and taking legal action in a bid to promote fossil fuels. When a lawsuit was filed to block the nation’s first major offshore wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, it appeared to be a straightforward clash between those who earn their living from the sea and others who would install turbines and underwater cables that could interfere with the harvesting of squid, fluke and other fish."
Texas,2022,Q4,"Beyond making tough moments a little easier, cultivating levity is good for your health. Wendi Aarons was writing at her local library when the sound of an angry voice made everyone look up. A patron, outraged over a book policy, vowed to take her child to another library and stormed off after berating the staff. The entire room was “so upset,” recalled Ms. Aarons, a humorist in Austin, Texas. “It was just this awful, uncomfortable silence.”"
Texas,2022,Q4,"Flu cases are higher than usual for this time of year and are expected to soar in the coming weeks. Another virus, R.S.V., already is straining pediatric hospitals in some states. For more than two years, shuttered schools and offices, social distancing and masks granted Americans a reprieve from flu and most other respiratory infections. This winter is likely to be different."
Texas,2022,Q4,"A new study confirms that you don’t have to do a hard workout to reap the longevity rewards of exercise. Dashing up the stairs to your apartment, weaving between commuters as you dart toward the train — those small snippets of exercise, if they’re intense enough, can add up, according to a new study. The paper is among the first to examine what many exercise scientists have long hypothesized: A little bit of physical activity goes a long way, even movement you might not consider a workout."

A Texas man was arrested on Friday on a federal charge that he left a voice mail message threatening to kill a Boston doctor who provides care to gender nonconforming children, the authorities said."
Texas,2022,Q4,"An estimated seven people have died from Vibrio vulnificus.

After more than two decades of pleas from conservation groups, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Thursday announced protections for the lesser prairie chicken, a flamboyant, stocky bird that once covered America’s grasslands in the hundreds of thousands but whose population has since dwindled to roughly 30,000."
Texas,2023,Q1,"In “The People’s Hospital,” Ricardo Nuila explores the ways in which a space for those stranded by the American health care system serves as an unlikely model.

Texas,2023,Q1,The president has tried to highlight years of Republican proposals that call for scaling back popular — and increasingly expensive — federal programs.

Texas,2023,Q1,"“If politicians start using the court to undo doctors’ decisions, imagine where that can lead,” Ms. Harris said at a discussion on abortion with local lawmakers and medical officials. DES MOINES — Vice President Kamala Harris said on Thursday that a lawsuit seeking to overturn federal approval of a widely used abortion pill amounted to an attack on “our public health system as a whole.”"
Texas,2023,Q1,"Key industries — including some that the White House is backing through other policies — are lobbying to water down the first major new rules in a generation on chemicals that pose risks to humans. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is preparing to impose some of the first new rules in a generation to restrict or ban an array of toxic chemicals that are widely used in manufacturing, presenting the White House with tough choices between its economic agenda and public health."
Texas,2023,Q1,"Some of the migrants who were bused to New York City are now seeking asylum in Canada, where they hope to have an easier time getting work permits and health insurance. New York officials, who once condemned Texas leaders for busing migrants from the southern border, calling the treatment inhumane, are buying bus tickets for newcomers who want to go north and seek asylum in Canada."
Texas,2023,Q1,"Saying he wanted safe and orderly proceedings, Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk asked lawyers not to disclose the hearing and planned to add it to the public case file only the evening before. The federal judge in a closely watched lawsuit that seeks to overturn federal approval of a widely used abortion pill has scheduled the first hearing in the case for this week, but he planned to delay making the public aware of it, according to people familiar with the case."
Texas,2023,Q1,"The suit argues that rules applying to mifepristone unnecessarily limit patients’ access to medication abortion. The attorneys general of a dozen Democratic-controlled states sued the Food and Drug Administration on Friday, asking a judge to remove special restrictions that the federal agency has long applied to the first of two drugs used in medication abortion."
Texas,2023,Q1,"While multiple layers of protection surround the radioactive material, and levels of radiation outside the camera are not dangerous, it should be handled with care, state officials said. An industrial camera that contains sealed-off radioactive material has been missing for several days in the Houston area after workers noticed it was gone from their work site, the Texas Department of State Health Services said."
Texas,2023,Q1,"The law is the only one in the nation to prohibit the use separate from an overall abortion ban and is part of a growing effort by conservative states to target the pills. Wyoming on Friday became the first state to explicitly ban the use of pills for abortion, adding momentum to a growing push by conservative states and anti-abortion groups to target medication abortion, the method now used in a majority of pregnancy terminations in the United States."
Texas,2023,Q2,"If this isn’t what anti-abortion groups want, why won’t they fix it? It’s increasingly clear that it’s not safe to be pregnant in states with total abortion bans. Since the end of Roe v. Wade, there has been a barrage of gutting stories about women in prohibition states denied care for miscarriages or forced to continue nonviable pregnancies. Though some in the anti-abortion movement publicly justify this sort of treatment, others have responded with a combination of denial, deflection and conspiracy theorizing."
Texas,2023,Q2,"The tornado destroyed a trailer park as it pummeled the Texas Panhandle city of Perryton. At least 75 people were injured, the authorities said. A storm system that swept through Texas on Thursday evening killed three people and injured dozens of others, an official said, as the state braced for a weekend of brutal heat."
Texas,2023,Q2,"Democrats and abortion-rights leaders said the decision could be a catastrophe and used the moment to criticize Republicans, who remained relatively quiet on Friday. As Americans digested a Texas judge’s ruling on Friday night invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone — and a contradictory ruling from a Washington State judge ordering the F.D.A. to maintain its approval as is in some states — the divide in political reactions was as much between words and silence as it was between pro- and anti-abortion rights."
Texas,2023,Q2,"A federal judge’s decision to invalidate the F.D.A.’s approval of mifepristone could affect availability even in states where abortion is legal. The governor of Massachusetts has asked the University of Massachusetts to purchase a one-year supply of the abortion pill mifepristone, and issued an executive order shielding pharmacists who stock the drug, abortion providers and patients from criminal and civil liability."
Texas,2023,Q2,"A record-breaking heat wave is expected to worsen through the weekend as it spreads through nearby states.

Texas,2023,Q2,"A new law pre-empting local labor rules is part of an effort by Republicans in the Capitol to exert control over the state’s Democratic-led major cities. As the heat index hit 115 degrees on Monday, Karla Perez took a five-minute water break at a construction site in Dallas. Such rest breaks are required by the city, as they are in Austin."
Texas,2023,Q2,"The building conflict between moderates and hard-liners in one of the Republican Party’s most important states highlights tension over the future of the party. The impeachment of the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, by a majority of his fellow Republicans has exposed an undercurrent of division and discontent that is roiling the Republican Party in the most populous state where it still enjoys near total political control."
Texas,2023,Q2,"Gov. Greg Abbott is expanding state law enforcement on the border as some state leaders appear eager to test the waters on how far Texas can go in enforcing immigration law.

Texas,2023,Q2,"The DACA program has shielded hundreds of thousands of young adults from deportation, but they have not been able to access federal health insurance programs. WASHINGTON — President Biden on Thursday said his administration would expand health care coverage for nearly 600,000 immigrants who were brought to the country as children and are protected from deportation."
Texas,2023,Q3,"A “hold-the-line” operation has created tensions with federal agents who warn it could lead to more drownings. Officers ordered to carry out the measures are raising alarms. For more than two years, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has pursued an increasingly aggressive approach to the border, sending thousands of National Guard troops and police officers to patrol the Rio Grande and testing the legal limits of state action on immigration."
Texas,2023,Q3,"A fifth bus arrived in the city last weekend, bringing the number of migrants who have been transported since June to 199. Something many people have criticized as a political stunt playing out elsewhere in the country arrived in Southern California starting in mid-June."
Texas,2023,Q3,"The Kentucky Republican said he would finish his term as leader, which runs through 2024, and in the Senate, where he was elected to serve through 2026. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the longtime Republican leader whose recent medical episodes have raised questions about his ability to continue steering his party in the Senate, declared on Wednesday that he had no intention of relinquishing his top post or leaving Congress ahead of schedule."
Texas,2023,Q3,"The death appeared to be the first linked to Gov. Greg Abbott’s program of sending migrants from the border to Democratic-run cities.

Greg Abbott’s program to send migrants from Texas to Democratic-run cities in other states, officials said."

Senator Mitch McConnell’s second alarming medical episode before television cameras on Wednesday has renewed scrutiny on his health as well as speculation about possible replacements for the longtime leader should he be forced to step aside."
Texas,2023,Q3,"Extreme heat is the engine of planetary chaos. We ignore it at our peril. In 2019, I happened to be visiting Phoenix on a 115-degree day. I had a meeting one afternoon about 10 blocks from the hotel where I was staying downtown. I gamely thought I’d brave the heat and walk to it. How bad could the heat really be? I grew up in California, not the Arctic. I thought I knew heat. I was wrong. After walking three blocks, I felt dizzy. After seven blocks, my heart was pounding. After 10 blocks, I thought I was a goner."
Texas,2023,Q3,"Medical device makers have bankrolled a cottage industry of doctors and clinics that perform artery-clearing procedures that can lead to amputations. Kelly Hanna’s leg was amputated on a summer day in 2020, after a Michigan doctor who called himself the “leg saver” had damaged her arteries by snaking metal wires through them to clear away plaque."
Texas,2023,Q3,"His designer was taken aback. But then she set about creating “Lenny Kravitz meets Italian ’60s meets ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.’” When Kirk Ferguson asked Sara Story to design the interiors of his new house in Austin, Texas, his request was unlike any she had heard before."
Texas,2023,Q3,"With the Senate returning from its long summer recess, the minority leader circulated a note from the congressional doctor saying an examination and tests showed no signs of a stroke or seizure. Hoping to reassure his colleagues that he is physically able to continue as minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell released a letter on Tuesday from the attending physician of Congress declaring that an examination and tests had ruled out a stroke or seizure as causes of his recent on-camera medical episodes."
Texas,2023,Q3,"The minority leader’s health episode at the Capitol has intensified talk about a possible succession, a prospect that his colleagues have not seriously grappled with for years. It has been decades since there was any real uncertainty at the top of the Republican Party in the Senate. But Senator Mitch McConnell’s alarming freeze-up at a news conference on Wednesday at the Capitol, as well as new disclosures about other recent falls, have shaken his colleagues and intensified quiet discussion about how long he can stay in his position as minority leader, and whether change is coming at the top."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Lubbock County, home to more than 300,000 near the New Mexico border, has become the fourth and largest Texas county to bar travel assistance for abortions. In recent months, abortion opponents in Texas have succeeded in passing a growing number of local ordinances to prevent people from helping women travel to have abortions in nearby states that still allow the procedure."
Texas,2023,Q4,"A state court judge said a woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition could legally obtain an abortion despite the state’s bans.

Texas,2023,Q4,"Known as curanderas, they carry on a tradition long revered in local Hispanic culture. On a recent day, Chriselda Hernandez heard a knock at her door in the Texas border town of Edinburg. It was a college student who said she was suffering from a string of bad luck. A drunken driver had crashed into her car. Then someone broke into the new car she was driving and stole her laptop. “I need a limpia,” she pleaded — a spiritual cleanse."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Abortion politics are threatening a successful global AIDS program. For decades, the U.S. has bankrolled global efforts to fight the spread of AIDS, saving tens of millions of lives. Congress has extended the program on a bipartisan basis since President George W. Bush created it in 2003."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Also, attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, signed into law today a measure empowering the state’s police to arrest migrants who enter the state from Mexico without authorization. The legislation, which takes effect in March, is expected to set up a court fight between Texas and the federal government over immigration enforcement powers."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Also, Israeli evidence of Hamas operations. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. Despite Texas’ strict ban on abortion, a judge there ruled today that Kate Cox, whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, could terminate her 20-week pregnancy. Her case is believed to be among the first attempts to seek a court-approved abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Xavier Becerra, the health and human services secretary, suggested that states were doing far too little to make sure that children were not unfairly denied federal insurance. The Biden administration on Monday warned the governors of nine states of unusually high Medicaid coverage losses among children, suggesting that officials were failing to protect young, low-income Americans while winnowing the program’s rolls."
Texas,2023,Q4,It’s very hard to determine when an abortion is medically necessary. Many people were shocked when the Texas Supreme Court intervened recently to stop Kate Cox from getting an abortion in the state — an abortion needed to protect her health and future fertility after her fetus was diagnosed with a severe fetal anomaly in her second trimester. She ultimately traveled out of state to get the abortion she needed.
Texas,2023,Q4,"Five months into her tenure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Mandy K. Cohen is trying to put a human face on public health. Dr. Mandy K. Cohen dropped by the Fox affiliate in Dallas in November, just days after the governor of Texas signed a law barring private employers from requiring Covid-19 shots. If she thought promoting vaccination would be a tough sell in a ruby-red state, Dr. Cohen, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not give any indication."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Hundreds of migrants have ended up needing extensive treatment in U.S. hospitals after trying to scale barriers along the southern border. Ambulances rush them daily to hospitals in El Paso, San Diego and Tucson, Ariz., writhing in pain — bones poking out of arms and legs; skulls cracked; spines shattered. The men and women arrive on stretchers flanked by an agent in the telltale green uniform of the U.S. Border Patrol."
Utah,2020,Q1,"Medical schools and students are grappling with an unsettling practice: Performing pelvic exams on unconscious, non-consenting patients. Janine, a nurse in Arizona, checked into the hospital for stomach surgery in 2017. Before the procedure, she told her physician that she did not want medical students to be directly involved. But after the operation, Janine said, as the anesthesia wore off, a resident came by to inform her that she had gotten her period; the resident had noticed while conducting a pelvic exam."
Utah,2020,Q1,"The ruling, written by a Reagan appointee, said the administration failed to show how such rules would help Medicaid to meet its mission of covering the poor.

Utah,2020,Q1,"A shortage in testing has left sick people and health care workers around the U.S. without answers. Yet the list of celebrity patients grows every day, raising questions about privileged access. Politicians, celebrities, social media influencers and even N.B.A. teams have been tested for the new coronavirus. But as that list of rich, famous and powerful people grows by the day, so do questions about whether they are getting access to testing that is denied to other Americans."

She knew she needed to make reservations with her Ikon Pass, but when she checked online, all the February slots were already booked, thanks to pandemic-induced capacity restrictions and a particularly snowy February.

During her 20-week pregnancy ultrasound last month, a woman living near the Utah-Idaho border learned she had a major rupture in her amniotic sac.

Utah,2022,Q4,"Bipartisan legislation in the House targets not only the online activity of individual users but also the website operators hosting it. Lawmakers are seeking to make online assistance of suicide a federal crime, pushing to hold accountable both individual users and the tech companies and websites that allow such content on their platforms."
Utah,2022,Q4,"Leave the past behind, walk toward the monster and always notice loneliness. As the year winds down, it’s a time for both reflection and for looking ahead. I’ve been taking stock of the past year and keep coming back to this advice that I got from Terrence Real, a family therapist and author. “Intimacy isn’t something you have,” he told me. “It’s something you do.”"

Utah,2022,Q4,"Lawsuits claim the company, Philips Respironics, knew of problems with its breathing machines long before notifying customers of potential health risks. By 2015, Philips Respironics knew its breathing devices had a problem: Foam inside the CPAP machines,  which help people with sleep apnea breathe at night, was breaking off into black flecks and blowing into the mouths and noses of users."
Utah,2023,Q1,"The seven states that rely on the river for water are not expected to reach a deal on cuts. It appears the Biden administration will have to impose reductions. WASHINGTON — The seven states that rely on water from the shrinking Colorado River are unlikely to agree to voluntarily make deep reductions in their water use, negotiators say, which would force the federal government to impose cuts for the first time in the water supply for 40 million Americans."

Utah,2023,Q1,"Four states could ban transition care into young adulthood. Lawmakers in several others want to restrict drag shows in ways that could affect transgender performers broadly. It’s part of a long-term plan. Over the past three years, Republican state lawmakers have put forward a barrage of bills to regulate the lives of transgender youths, restricting the sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and medical care they can receive."
Utah,2023,Q1,"Josh Hawley may be right about this one thing. Last year, a study came out showing that left-leaning adolescents were experiencing a greater increase in depression than their more conservative peers. Indeed, while girls are more likely to be depressed than boys, the study, by a group of epidemiologists at Columbia, showed that liberal boys had higher rates of depression than conservative girls."
Utah,2023,Q1,"Single moms who chose to quit their jobs have to navigate child care, health insurance and financial concerns largely on their own. But some have also found a sense of relief. In 2022, Lizzie Saltsman, 43, quit her job, and took her children on a summer trip across Europe. She rented a car and for two months she and her four children, all under 13, drove across the continent, beginning in Paris, with stops in places like Switzerland, Austria and Italy."
Utah,2023,Q1,"Many of the legal arguments seeking to overturn abortion bans rely on rights provided by the states, and how they are interpreted by state supreme courts. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in June, it declared that it was sending the issue back to the “people and their elected representatives.” But the fight has largely moved to a different set of supreme courts and constitutions: those in the states."
Utah,2023,Q1,"No. 15 Princeton toppled Arizona, a No. 2 seed that was one of the favorites in the field, while No. 13 seed Furman knocked down No. 4 Virginia.

Utah,2023,Q1,Republicans and Democrats have sharply divergent approaches to repairing the programs. Any solutions will affect younger workers as much as retirees. The unusual back and forth between President Biden and Republican lawmakers on live television during last week’s State of the Union address kicked off a high-stakes political debate about repairing Social Security and Medicare.
Utah,2023,Q1,"The first hearing of a House panel charged with investigating the origins of the pandemic underscored just how difficult it might be to turn up conclusive evidence. WASHINGTON — The former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention accused top federal health officials on Wednesday of excluding him from discussions in early 2020 about whether the coronavirus was the result of a laboratory leak — an assertion that one of the officials, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, later said had “nothing to do with reality.”"
Utah,2023,Q1,"With loosened rules around remote prescriptions, a psychedelic-like drug has become a popular treatment for mental health conditions. But a boom in at-home use has outpaced evidence of safety. For Greg Rice, ketamine was transformative. The drug, approved decades ago to sedate patients during surgery, was increasingly being used to treat mental health conditions like his depression."
Utah,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."

Wade to remind voters of Republican opposition to measures with broad voter approval."
Utah,2023,Q2,"After the surgeon general warned that social media harms young people, young New Yorkers agreed. Some also said that the government — and their parents — should back off.

Utah,2023,Q3,"A reader wonders when it’s OK to abandon the undergarment. You are not the only one having an anti-bra moment. When many dressing mores went out the window during the pandemic lockdowns, the no-bra movement, which has resurfaced regularly since the 1960s, once again began picking up steam (led, in part, by Florence Pugh, above)."
Utah,2023,Q3,"The Utah Republican’s announcement that he would retire coincided with the publication of a forthcoming book based on extensive interviews in which he slammed his party and the Senate.

Utah,2023,Q3,"Many patients say they avoid sweets to help fight the disease. But while a healthy diet is important, you can’t “starve a tumor.” During the eight years Stacy Shawhan has worked as an oncology dietitian, she has heard many questions from her cancer patients about how their diets influence their prognosis. But one question has come up more than the rest: Will consuming sugary foods and drinks feed my cancer cells, making my condition worse?"
Utah,2023,Q3,"Dr. Brian P. Monahan has been thrust into the center of a political controversy as Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, seeks to dismiss concerns about his age and health.

Utah,2023,Q3,"Senators steered clear of the social policy dictates that sapped Democratic support for the House bill, but the legislation was headed for a contentious negotiation to reach a final agreement. The Senate on Thursday gave overwhelming approval to the annual defense policy bill, sidestepping a contentious debate over abortion access for service members and quashing efforts to limit aid for Ukraine in a show of bipartisanship that set up a bitter showdown with the House."
Utah,2023,Q3,"Parents and public health experts have a lot to say about what adolescent girls do on their phones. We asked teens to weigh in. Psychologists suggest teenagers take social media breaks, and ask themselves as they scroll: “Do I feel bad about myself while looking at this?” Public health experts recommend “adult monitoring” and setting clear boundaries for when and where teens have access to their phones. The surgeon general wants parents to keep their child’s bedroom device-free for at least an hour before bedtime, and through the night. In Utah, lawmakers have determined that kids under 18 should not have access to TikTok or Instagram without parental permission."

Utah,2023,Q4,"The journalist McKay Coppins takes stock of the politician and former presidential candidate’s career as he prepares to retire from elective office. “For most of his life, he has nursed a morbid fascination with his own death, suspecting that it might assert itself one day suddenly and violently.” One doesn’t expect these opening words from an authorized biography of a handsome, wealthy, happily married and instinctively moderate man, but this is how McKay Coppins’s “Romney” begins. Perhaps Mitt Romney fears his severance from so many blessings, but as Coppins’s revealing new book demonstrates, this businessman-politician has often wondered if he deserved such an abundance of good fortune at all."
Utah,2023,Q4,The deaths of two people who drank Panera “charged lemonade” have renewed the debate over the health risks of highly caffeinated drinks. A pair of recent lawsuits over the deaths of two people who had consumed a highly caffeinated lemonade at Panera Bread have renewed longstanding questions about the safety of energy drinks.

Utah,2023,Q4,"There are two Americas, and they are divided by a college degree. By many measures, the U.S. economy is thriving: Unemployment stands close to the 50-year low set in April, the fraction of people age 25 to 54 in work is at a two-decade high, gross domestic product is growing rapidly, inflation is falling, and the S&P 500 is a third higher than it was before the Covid pandemic."
Utah,2023,Q4,"You’ll need to adjust for your shortcomings (and take a well-timed nap). Most of us know that good sleep is a pillar of good health, on par with exercise and nutrition. And yet most of us have had a night (or many nights) when it all went sideways."

Utah,2023,Q4,"Their technology is impressive, but imperfect. We asked experts whether they can really help you get a better night’s rest. Shawn McCall, 48, a personal trainer in Waterford, Mich., started tracking his sleep almost six years ago.

Utah,2023,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage. For 35 years, Angela Jemmott and her five brothers paid premiums on a long-term care insurance policy for their 91-year-old mother. But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."

Vermont,2020,Q1,"The decision dealt a blow to Joe Biden, who had hoped his longstanding ties to organized labor would win him the union’s coveted support. A powerful union in Nevada declined to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary, dealing a blow to former Vice President Joseph R.

Vermont,2020,Q1,"With the coronavirus as a backdrop, and with no audience in attendance, the two Democrats were at times feisty discussing their differences over health care. Mr. Biden also committed to choosing a woman as a running mate. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders called for vastly more aggressive government action to battle the coronavirus but split over some of the details along familiar ideological lines on Sunday night, as the two Democrats tangled over the right to lead their party into a campaign overshadowed by the pandemic inflicting havoc on the country’s economy and its social fabric."
Vermont,2020,Q1,"The Vermont senator has made exaggerated claims or statements that lacked context about “Medicare for all,” his antiwar record and his history of bipartisanship.

Vermont,2020,Q2,"The move would have made it easier for people who have recently lost jobs to obtain health insurance.

Even if no other good for health care emerges from the coronavirus crisis, one development — the incorporation of telemedicine into routine medical care — promises to be transformative. Using technology that already exists and devices that most people have in their homes, medical practice over the internet can result in faster diagnoses and treatments, increase the efficiency of care and reduce patient stress."
Vermont,2020,Q2,"The pandemic has closed many mental-health residential centers, sending residents home to families ill equipped for the challenges. The panic spirals up from somewhere in Connor Langan’s midsection, and so quickly that his face changes; wild in the eyes, his upper lip trembling, he sometimes punches a wall in frustration. Such episodes resulted in Connor, 17, being placed on leave from high school late last year, and in early March he agreed to enroll at Mountain Valley, a New Hampshire residential program well known for addressing anxiety problems in young people."
Vermont,2020,Q2,"The unequal impact of the pandemic and economic collapse are forcing us to rethink the assumptions of our system. We are the richest country in the history of the world, but at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, that reality means little to half of our people who live paycheck to paycheck, the 40 million living in poverty, the 87 million who are uninsured or underinsured, and the half million who are homeless."

Vermont,2020,Q2,"Despite executive orders for social distancing, Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms continue to offer homes and “quarantine apartments” as retreats. As communities tighten rules on social distancing, the short-term rental has become a fraught piece of turf. In areas like the Jersey Shore and Newport Beach, Calif., and in states like Pennsylvania and Vermont, officials have severely restricted short-term rentals to discourage residents of urban hot zones from spreading the coronavirus to lower-density locations. Recent evidence has shown that their caution is justified."

And the topic came up at the Group of 7 summit in Japan."
Vermont,2023,Q2,"New York does not require bystanders to act when someone is in danger, but the killing on the F train has residents debating when they should step in. As Jordan Neely struggled to free himself from a chokehold in the New York City subway earlier this month, there were the passengers who pinned him down and the passengers who watched."
Vermont,2023,Q2,"Brandon Johnson, a progressive Democrat, prevailed over his more moderate challenger after holding the position that officials must take a fundamentally different approach to public safety. CHICAGO — The mayoral victory on Tuesday of Brandon Johnson, a once little-known progressive and former teacher, over a more moderate veteran of this city’s burly political realm injected confidence in the Democratic Party’s most liberal wing — and may have pointed a way forward for the party on the fraught issue of crime."
Vermont,2023,Q2,"But advocates can’t agree on a strategy to hold more ballot initiatives. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion access has fared very well when it has appeared on the ballot."

Vermont,2023,Q3,"Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii sees lessons far beyond the islands in the disaster that has unfolded on Maui. In early 2020, with state health officials downplaying signs of the coming pandemic, Josh Green, who was then Hawaii’s lieutenant governor, went outside the political pecking order and called the White House himself to ask for a temporary ban on cruise ships, a linchpin of Hawaii’s economy."

Vermont,2023,Q3,"The exhibition “Barvalo” is billed as the first show of its kind to combine contributions from multiple Romani artists and curators.

Vermont,2023,Q3,"Plus, the U.S. reached a deal with Iran to free Americans. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday.

Vermont,2023,Q3,"Hoping to break through a crowded presidential field in 2024, the former Texas congressman is pitching himself as a modern and moderate Republican with a bipartisan vision.

Vermont,2023,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated.

Vermont,2023,Q3,"The BBC is no ordinary media outlet and its presenter is no ordinary journalist. But the network’s wall-to-wall coverage has raised questions of its own. There were urgent NATO meetings about the war in Ukraine, raging floods from India to Vermont, and a record heat wave across America. But this week the BBC wound up airing wall-to-wall coverage of a different story: itself."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"“Woman,” which she hosted, brought frank talk about issues like birth control, pay inequality and homosexuality into millions of homes in the 1970s. Sandra Elkin, who as the creator and host of the weekly PBS talk show “Woman” in the mid-1970s brought frank discussions about birth control, job discrimination, health care and other issues confronting American women into millions of living rooms across the country, died on Nov. 8 at her home in Manhattan.

Vermont,2023,Q4,"Adult children discuss the trials of caring for their aging parents: unreliable agencies, a lack of help and dwindling financial resources. I am 39 years old. I had to care for my father, who passed from cancer in 2019; my mother, who passed in November 2021 from cancer; and since her passing I have inherited the care of my grandmother. She is 97, diagnosed with moderate dementia and is considered high risk to be left home alone. We had been applying for Medicaid long-term care to receive a home health aide since early November 2021. She finally got a home health aide in January 2022, but it’s been a nightmare. They are so desperate to hire workers that they will take anyone. She was left without an aide on many random days with a late-notice telephone call or text message from the aide needing the day off and the agencies not able to find a replacement in time. I have changed agencies multiple times. My husband has been a great support the entire time. We rely on security cameras we installed in our apartment to see how she is doing while we are at work. How is it on a daily basis? It is emotionally and physically draining. The health care system for the elderly is neglected, broken and inadequate to meet any demands, even the basic needs."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"The progressive disappointment with the Vermont senator, a liberal icon, reflects a broader divide among Democrats over the war. On a Democratic primary debate stage in Brooklyn in 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders caused a ruckus within his party when he rebuked Hillary Clinton for not mentioning Palestinian rights in a speech she made to a pro-Israel lobbying group."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"Some older adults are skipping a sun-drenched post-work life and moving instead to the next step: choosing to live near children and grandchildren.

But unable to make a final decision she asked her elder daughter, a college administrator in Richmond, Va., to come north and weigh in."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"There are ways to reduce the stress and expense of ending a marriage, but they require both parties to want to end the relationship civilly. If there is an easy point of agreement in the emotional upheaval of divorce, it is that endless legal battles can break the bank."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"If you notice drastic shifts in your mood during certain times of the year, you could have seasonal affective disorder. Here are answers to your top questions about the condition.

Vermont,2023,Q4,"We have the tools we need to create a world where addiction is just one aspect of people’s lives instead of a dark portal to despair and early death. Raina Mcmahan, a 42-year-old recovery coach, spent roughly half her life seeking treatment for her own opioid use disorder."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"A third day of hostage exchanges in Israel. Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, released 17 more hostages, including a 4-year-old girl, and said it would seek to extend a temporary cease-fire with Israel.

Virginia,2020,Q1,"As the coronavirus spreads, the public interest requires employers to abandon their longstanding resistance to paid sick leave. Most American restaurants do not offer paid sick leave. Workers who fall sick face a simple choice: Work and get paid or stay home and get stiffed.

Virginia,2020,Q1,"When concerns about a pipeline were dismissed by regulators, a rural black enclave went to court — and won. In the years following the Civil War, freedmen and freedwomen founded a community close to the Virginia plantations where they had been enslaved.

Virginia,2020,Q1,"Virginia’s shift to the Democrats has been led by suburban moderates, especially college-educated women. Some wonder whether Mr. Sanders is what they signed up for. VIRGINIA BEACH — In the Trump era, the suburbs have been Democrats’ surprising superpower."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"Several of the nation’s top health officials are among those sitting on an advisory panel formed by President Trump.

Featured Article: “What Happened When a State Made Food Stamps Harder to Get” by Campbell Robertson."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"Medicaid expansion is just the latest example of how liberal policies make for good politics. When left-wing Democrats push for universal benefits and expansive new policies, they do so with a theory of politics in mind. It goes like this: The reason to fight for debt-free college or Medicare for all isn’t just to improve life for Americans, but to build new ground for progressive political activity. New programs create new constituencies, and new programs with broad benefits can give more Americans a stake in the expansion and preservation of the welfare state. Conservatives know this. That’s why they’ve fought so hard to block or undermine even modest new programs."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"Protesters in Virginia were re-enacting — and re-embracing — an exclusionary vision of American history. RICHMOND, Va. — Around 22,000 people came here on Monday to protest potential new restrictions on guns under consideration by the new Democratic majority in the General Assembly.

Virginia,2020,Q2,"The death of Gerald O. Glenn, the bishop of the New Deliverance Evangelistic Church in Chesterfield, Va., was announced during Easter services.

Virginia,2020,Q2,"Most of us had never heard of aerosol science before the pandemic. Then Virginia Tech’s Linsey Marr showed up and became our tour guide to the invisible world of airborne particles. When Linsey Marr’s son started attending day care 12 years ago, she noticed that he kept getting sick with the sniffles and other minor illnesses. But unlike most parents, Dr. Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech, tried to figure out why."

Virginia,2021,Q2,"The senator has become a lightning rod in his party and a major obstacle to President Biden’s agenda. In his home state, his stubborn belief in bipartisanship is recognized as the core of his being. FARMINGTON, W.Va. — Decades ago, John Manchin Jr., a civic leader in a small coal town in West Virginia, lent his support to a Democrat running for Congress.

Virginia,2021,Q3,"A $16 billion effort to modernize health records at the Department of Veterans Affairs ran into major problems in its first installation, two watchdog reports say. The Department of Veterans Affairs is in the process of overhauling the country’s oldest electronic health record system at the country’s largest hospital network. Even if it goes smoothly, planners have repeatedly warned, it will be an extremely complicated task that will take 10 years and cost more than $16 billion."

Virginia,2021,Q4,"The first Republican governor of the state in almost a century, he seemed to herald a new, post-racial South. He later became disillusioned with his own party. A. Linwood Holton Jr., who as Virginia’s first Republican governor in nearly a century knocked loose the stranglehold of white supremacy on the state, cleaned up its waterways and promoted a vision for a biracial Republican coalition across the South, died on Oct. 28 at his home in Kilmarnock, Va. He was 98."
Virginia,2021,Q4,"Some Virginia Democrats want to codify abortion rights into state law in their final weeks in power. But several state senators do not want to upend their travel to Hawaii, Europe and Africa. Democrats have less than a month left controlling Virginia before Republicans take over the House of Delegates and the governor’s mansion. With the clock ticking, many in the party want to seize what they see as a fleeting opportunity: protecting abortion rights by codifying them into state law."
Virginia,2021,Q4,"After almost two years of remote schooling, restricted gatherings and constant testing, many students are isolated and depressed. Omicron may make things worse.

Virginia,2021,Q4,"The incoming lieutenant governor of Virginia was an unlikely candidate: a deeply conservative Black woman, and an immigrant, who supports Donald Trump. RICHMOND, Va. — On a December afternoon, Winsome Sears, Virginia’s lieutenant governor-elect, stood at the podium in the State Senate chamber where she will soon preside. It was empty but for a few clerks and staffers who were walking her through a practice session, making pretend motions and points of order. Ms. Sears followed along as the clerks explained arcane Senate protocols, though she occasionally raised matters that weren’t in the script."

WASHINGTON — For years, burly men in camouflage hunting jackets have been a constant presence in the Capitol Hill office of Senator Joe Manchin III, their United Mine Workers logos giving away their mission: to lobby not only for the interests of coal, but also on more personal matters such as pensions, health care and funding to address black lung disease."
Virginia,2022,Q1,"President Biden has made “harm reduction” a central pillar of his plan to fight a record number of drug-related deaths, but a conservative backlash is threatening the effort.

Virginia,2022,Q3,"The wider latitude conferred by a state’s public health emergency was critical to states’ responses to earlier waves of coronavirus cases. When all 50 states, the District of Columbia and United States territories declared public health emergencies in response to the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, those declarations allowed state officials to lift limits on hospital capacity, expand access to telehealth services and even allow highway weight limits to be exceeded, in case the National Guard needed to quickly move in."

Employees at the facility told inspectors they did not know how long she had been stuck."

Virginia,2022,Q4,"Caring for seriously ill patients needing round-the-clock attention during the pandemic has added layers of commitment. An alphabet soup of respiratory illnesses has been spreading misery across the United States, once again pushing hospital staff to the brink.

But as the drought drags on, is talking enough? LA JUNTA, Colo. — Before Freud and before the pharmaceutical industry came to define what we understand as mental illness, doctors used to prescribe wealthy men suffering nervous breakdowns “the West Cure.” Building on the theories of George Miller Beard, who blamed modern life for frayed nerves, they recommended elites like Teddy Roosevelt trade reading their newspapers for a regimen of riding and roping beneath the cavernous skies. More than a century later, modern life has only gotten faster, and from Bozeman, Mont., to Denver, the West remains a popular place to retreat from it all. But the West Cure was never meant for the people who actually live there."
Virginia,2022,Q4,"Vulnerable Democrats in competitive districts have leaned into preserving abortion rights as a closing argument for their campaigns, buoyed by internal polls that show it has moved voters their way.

Virginia,2023,Q1,"The guidelines are rooted in a premise that should have been rejected long ago: that weight loss is the best path to health and happiness. This month, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its first comprehensive guidelines for evaluating and treating children and adolescents with obesity. The paper, co-written by 21 prominent doctors, health researchers and obesity experts, advises health care providers that they may refer children as young as 2 years old to “intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment” programs if they have a body mass index in the overweight or obese range.

Virginia,2023,Q2,"A year later, the consequences for women have been alarming.

The decision upheld a Pennsylvania school district’s expulsion of a Jehovah’s Witness brother and sister. A single member of the court dissented."

Virginia,2023,Q3,"Proud resistance is our secret birthright. The striking miners were 10,000 strong on the first day of September 1921 as they charged up the slope of Blair Mountain, propelled by a radical faith in the American dream. According to an Associated Press reporter who crouched behind a log and watched through field glasses, each time they pressed forward, a “veritable wall” of machine gun fire drove them back. As the barrage echoed through the hollows, reminding some of the action they had just seen in the forests of France, the advancing miners soon heard a different sound: deeper, earthshaking explosions. From biplanes above, tear gas, explosive powder and metal bolts rained down. “My God,” screamed one miner fighting his way up Crooked Creek Gap. “They’re bombing us!”"

Crushing chest pain, an itch that festers into torment, an inconsolable baby, no place to sleep at 3 a.m., an ankle twisted on a jog, a fentanyl overdose, a car crash, the need to tell someone, “I feel sad and lonely.” The only place that tends to this kaleidoscope of needs is the emergency room, its doors perpetually open to all."

Washington,2020,Q1,"Experiences in Washington State and Colorado demonstrate the challenges of trying to create a nationwide insurance plan. Government insurance advocates who are skeptical of Medicare for All’s prospects are placing their hopes on the “public option” as an easier-to-enact step in the same direction. All of the leading competitors to Bernie Sanders, who remains unyielding in his commitment to single-payer health care, have embraced some version of what Pete Buttigieg calls “Medicare for all who want it.”"
Washington,2020,Q1,"Local health departments around the United States are scrambling to monitor thousands of people returning from travel in China and elsewhere. Among the tasks: daily calls, emails, texts. After a long journey at sea on the Westerdam cruise ship, which was denied entry at ports across Asia over fears of the coronavirus, Holley Rauen finally returned home to Florida on Wednesday night.

He was 88. "
Washington,2020,Q1,"With more than 500 cases in almost three dozen states, officials worry that containment efforts aren’t enough. As the coronavirus gained a foothold in the United States, thousands of employees from Seattle to Silicon Valley were told to work from home.

A global health conference in Orlando, Fla., planned for Monday, which President Trump was supposed to address, will no longer happen."
Washington,2020,Q1,"To understand how union members in Las Vegas are thinking about Bernie Sanders, it helps to remember a picket line in the 1990s.

Washington,2020,Q2,State regulators in New York and elsewhere are also trying to stop the marketing of plans they say look like health insurance but offer no guarantees of coverage.

LUSAKA, Zambia — There are few nurses in the Zambian capital with the skills and experience of Alex Mulumba, who works in the operating room at a critical care hospital. But he has recently learned, through a barrage of social media posts and LinkedIn solicitations, that many faraway places are eager for his expertise, too — and will pay him far more than the $415 per month (including an $8 health risk bonus) he earns now."
Washington,2022,Q2,"Why health care needs labor peace agreements. America was in a health care crisis before Covid, and the stresses of the pandemic have made it worse. Since the pandemic began, the health care work force — the country’s largest industry by employment — has shrunk by nearly 2 percent. That may seem like a small amount, but historically, the health care work force doesn’t shrink; it only grows. Now, with astronomical turnover and rising demand as patients seek care that they may have put off during the height of the pandemic, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and home care agencies across the country lack sufficient staff members to adequately care for patients."

Washington,2022,Q3,"There is no technological miracle that will fix decades of bad policy. What if you could get health care as quickly and easily as you order socks and cat litter?

Washington,2023,Q2,"Cases dropped after a successful public health campaign last summer. But the disease still has a low-level presence in the city, and many people remain at risk.

Washington,2023,Q2,"Democrats and abortion-rights leaders said the decision could be a catastrophe and used the moment to criticize Republicans, who remained relatively quiet on Friday.

Wisconsin,2022,Q3,"State abortion bans carry narrow but sometimes vague exceptions, and years of prison time. That’s forcing doctors to think like lawyers, and hospitals to create new protocols.

Yet even with that outpouring of stories, plus polls showing broad opposition to the bans and an increase in women registering to vote, it’s still unclear if the issue will be the deciding factor for voters in the midterm elections on Tuesday."

Wisconsin,2023,Q1,"The federal government loosened regulations for buprenorphine, but health experts warn that entrenched problems around training and access could stall efforts to get people the medication. BALTIMORE — Buprenorphine, a medication to treat opioid addiction, has quietly stabilized Randall Lambert’s drug use over the past 15 years, even as chaos surrounded him. He cycled in and out of rehab facilities and jail, but the buprenorphine he took eased his heroin cravings and kept him from withdrawal. He is now sober, living in a rehab facility and nurturing relationships with his three children and his mother."

Wisconsin,2023,Q1,"I’m afraid pregnant women will die if we don’t change Tennessee’s abortion law. Before the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v.

Wisconsin,2023,Q1,"Our right to free expression should not be contingent on our ability to gain political control. The Constitution of the United States, properly interpreted, provides a marvelous method for handling social conflict. It empowers an elected government to enact even contentious new rules while protecting the most fundamental human rights of dissenting citizens. Political defeat is never total defeat. Losers of a given election still possess their basic civil liberties, and the combination of the right to speak and the right to vote provides them concrete hope for their preferred political outcomes."
Wisconsin,2023,Q1,"Crossings by migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti have plummeted, but Republicans and some Democrats have attacked the new policies.

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"The ad, paid for by the Democratic National Committee, tries to take back the mantle of patriotism often claimed by Republicans, leaning heavily on images of the flag and of the Capitol riot. The first television advertisement for President Biden’s re-election campaign aired on Wednesday, an opening salvo that leans heavily on images of the American flag, warns of domestic threats to democracy and repeatedly invokes the word “freedom.”"
Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"What should we make of the role that abortion played in both the Chicago and Wisconsin elections this week? The elections this week in Chicago and Wisconsin were different in many ways. One was for mayor, the other for a state Supreme Court seat.

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"Some in the party are urging compromise, warning of dire electoral consequences for 2024, while other stances, on guns and gay rights, also risk turning off moderates.

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults.

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"As MDMA and psilocybin treatments become more mainstream, the therapy component has come under scrutiny. Here’s what’s common in many sessions — and what’s not. Psychedelic therapy is on its way to becoming a mainstream medical treatment in mental health care.

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"Binge eating disorder entered the diagnostic manual on mental health conditions 10 years ago. It’s still getting overlooked. At 2 or 3 a.m., David Tedrow would hide the empty cardboard cereal box, shoving it into the bottom of the trash can or the back of the cupboard, where his wife wouldn’t notice it.

Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"States can push hospitals to look at California’s model and other proven ways to reduce maternal mortality. Years ago, researchers discovered that American women were dying in childbirth at an alarming rate, far higher than in many other Western countries. Black women, they found, were dying at even more elevated rates. Data in hand, they called for change."
Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"A federal gun law passed last year gave the Biden administration a powerful new tool to increase background checks on “private” firearms sales. Will the administration use it?

Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"The Democratic presidential challenger continues to espouse extreme ideas, but has dialed that messaging back in large public forums. In an online meeting with anti-vaccine activists on June 27, Robert F.

He also claimed that such research could have created Covid-19, H.I.V. and other deadly viruses."

Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"As states and counties spend the first wave of billions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry, public health groups are challenging how some funds are being used.

Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"Thirty years of progress in decreasing drowning deaths in the United States appears to have plateaued, and disparities in deaths among some racial groups have worsened.

Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"Dr. Brian P. Monahan has been thrust into the center of a political controversy as Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, seeks to dismiss concerns about his age and health.

Wisconsin,2023,Q4,"With post-Roe outrage showing no sign of waning, strategists on the right are pushing a new lexicon on abortion. In the year since Roe v.

Conservatives are even considering moving away from the term “pro-life,” fearing that voters have newly negative associations with the label."
Wisconsin,2023,Q4,"How do teenagers use social media, and what might be the benefits and risks of life online? Dr. Vivek Murthy, the United States surgeon general, issued an advisory in May about the risks of social media to the brains and mental health of children and adolescents.

Wisconsin,2023,Q4,"Tens of millions of Americans are struggling to cope with soaring temperatures. OSHA is developing new workplace safety standards, but they are not yet complete. Anthony Soto, a 22-year-old baggage claim employee at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, crumpled to the floor near gate C15 after a seizure last October that he attributed to hot indoor conditions and strenuous lifting. In record-setting heat in Texas this past summer, Mr. Soto, who has epilepsy, had four more seizures that left him speechless, his body unresponsive, he said."
Wisconsin,2023,Q4,"Tuesday’s election on an abortion-related ballot initiative could have consequences beyond the state. By Nov. 7, my fellow Ohioans will cast votes on Issue 1, a ballot initiative that would secure access to reproductive health care, including abortion.

Wyoming,2021,Q2,"Production problems and a brief pause on its use kept the one-dose vaccine from becoming the game changer that health officials across the country believed it would be. WASHINGTON — When Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose coronavirus vaccine was authorized for emergency use in late February, ​it was seen as a breakthrough for reaching vulnerable and isolated Americans, a crucial alternative to vaccines that require two shots weeks apart and fussier storage. It was soon popular on college campuses, in door-to-door campaigns and with harder-to-reach communities that often struggle with access to health care."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"Private colleges make up the bulk of the schools with vaccine mandates, but some public universities have also moved to require shots, according to a survey by The New York Times. More than 100 colleges across the United States have said they will require students to receive coronavirus vaccines in order to attend in-person classes in the fall, according to a New York Times survey."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"The shift away from high-volume centers is an acknowledgment of the harder road ahead: a highly targeted push, akin to get-out-the-vote efforts, to persuade the reluctant to get shots. NEWARK — There were only six tiny vials of coronavirus vaccine in the refrigerator, one Air Force nurse on duty and a trickle of patients on Saturday morning at a federally run mass vaccination site here. A day before its doors shut for good, this once-frenetic operation was oddly quiet."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"Speaking at the White House, the president did not mention his goal of getting 70 percent of adults partly vaccinated by July 4 but trumpeted a different milestone: 300 million shots in his first 150 days in office. WASHINGTON — With the United States unlikely to reach his self-imposed deadline of having 70 percent of adults partly vaccinated against the coronavirus by July 4, President Biden on Friday stepped up his drive for Americans to get their shots, warning that those who decline risk becoming infected by a highly contagious and potentially deadly variant."

Wyoming,2021,Q3,"The park had more than 920,000 recreational visits in August, surpassing its previous busiest August on record, in 2017, when crowds came out to watch a solar eclipse. Hundreds of thousands of people traveled to America’s national parks this summer, breaking a record at Yellowstone as the authorities relaxed domestic travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic."
Wyoming,2021,Q3,"In remarks on Friday, the president said his mandates would prevail and expressed disappointment with Republican governors who “have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of their communities.” Republican governors across the country assailed President Biden’s aggressive moves to require vaccinations as an unconstitutional attack on personal freedoms and vowed to sue the administration to block the requirements."
Wyoming,2021,Q3,"A top White House adviser said monoclonal antibody treatments, sometimes underused, could still be crucial in helping people with Covid-19 avoid getting very sick. WASHINGTON — Facing overcrowded hospitals and an unrelenting surge of Delta variant cases around the country, the Biden administration on Thursday renewed its call for health providers to use monoclonal antibody treatments, which can help Covid-19 patients who are at risk of getting very sick."
Wyoming,2021,Q3,"As companies navigate vaccine requirements, a high-profile Silicon Valley trial is set to begin. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for people 16 and older, kicking off a new wave of company vaccine mandates. Delta Air Lines announced a new approach to encouraging, rather than requiring, employees to take the vaccine: Starting Nov. 1, unvaccinated workers will have to pay an additional $200 per month to remain on the company’s health care plan. It’s unclear how effective the policy will be. Studies of employer wellness programs that promote healthy behavior, such as quitting smoking, by offering rewards or imposing penalties have shown little effect on employee health. But employees may respond differently to a program focused on vaccination, which doesn’t require a long-term behavior change."
Wyoming,2021,Q3,"But the tortuous path it’s taken highlights the obstacles to expanding the low-income health program in other states where it has not been welcomed. The Missouri Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Medicaid expansion to go forward there, ruling unanimously Thursday that the state legislature must fund the new program. The Obamacare program is expected to bring coverage to approximately 275,000 low-income people."

Wyoming,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit was filed a day after the announcement of a Jan. 4 deadline for the companies to begin their mandates or start weekly testing. The attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday in an effort to prevent the Biden administration from requiring large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations, the latest sign of growing pushback against the federal government’s biggest effort yet to enlist private businesses in combating the virus."
Wyoming,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit is being led by Missouri’s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, and the attorney general of Nebraska, Doug Peterson. Ten Republican-led states filed a lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Missouri accusing the Biden administration of a broad range of overreaches in mandating that employees of federal contractors be vaccinated against the coronavirus by Dec. 8."

A surge in Covid cases and a shortage of health care workers is filling hospitals and nursing homes past their capacity in upstate New York, creating a growing crisis in the health care system even before the Omicron variant is known to have spread through the area, according to hospital executives from Buffalo to Albany."
Wyoming,2021,Q4,"Experts and tribal leaders aren’t sure why, but living near communities with low vaccination rates may be contributing. The Navajo Nation managed to tame Covid-19 earlier this year, mounting a campaign that drove its vaccination rate far above the United States average, after the virus ravaged the Navajo people."

Wyoming,2022,Q1,"The Supreme Court will hear from two convicted pill mill doctors in cases that could have significant implications for physicians’ latitude to prescribe addictive painkillers. For years, Dr. Xiulu Ruan was one of the nation’s top prescribers of quick-release fentanyl drugs. The medicines were approved only for severe breakthrough pain in cancer patients, but Dr. Ruan dispensed them almost exclusively for more common ailments: neck aches, back and joint pain. According to the Department of Justice, he and his partner wrote almost 300,000 prescriptions for controlled substances from 2011 to 2015, filled through the doctors’ own pharmacy in Mobile, Ala. Dr. Ruan often signed prescriptions without seeing patients, prosecutors said."

Wyoming,2022,Q1,"The staff at a vaccination site in Watts has spent seven months trying to turn the tide of vaccine hesitancy. LOS ANGELES — Two million. That’s the number of unvaccinated people in Los Angeles County — more than three times the population of Wyoming, and a commentary on the sheer scale of the county, the nation’s most populous by far. It’s also an indicator on how vulnerable Los Angeles remains to the coronavirus."
Wyoming,2022,Q1,"Drawing on childhood grammar lessons, the justices considered whether the doctors were entitled to argue that they had acted in good faith. WASHINGTON — Against the backdrop of a national crisis of soaring opioid overdoses and deaths, the Supreme Court on Tuesday considered the cases of two doctors accused of operating pill mills, with the justices struggling to articulate a legal standard that would separate unconventional medical practices from drug dealing."

Wyoming,2022,Q1,"For the past 10 years, wolves have been steadily returning to the state after being wiped out a century ago. But not everyone is rolling out the welcome mat. Kent Laudon, a wolf biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, woke up one morning last year to a flurry of text messages from a rancher in the state’s northernmost county. He was asking about a post with wildly specific details spreading across Facebook that urged people to find a red truck that was transporting breeding wolves along Route 97 into Siskiyou County, Calif. Mr. Laudon was not surprised. This wasn’t the first post of its kind, and it wouldn’t be the last."
Wyoming,2022,Q1,"The lack of consequences for Republican leaders over Jan. 6 has Democrats worried for the future.  But some also expressed empathy for the rioters. This article is based on a focus group we held with Democratic voters about the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and the health of American democracy.

The F.B.I. started airing a radio ad last week seeking information about the fatal shooting of a man in Naschitti, N.M., within the Navajo Nation."
Wyoming,2022,Q2,"Anti-abortion laws that don’t prioritize women’s health. In December, I wrote a newsletter with the headline, “Overturning Roe Will Make Miscarriage Care Worse.” I pointed out that because the options that doctors have to end a miscarriage that doesn’t happen on its own — medication or surgery — are the same ones involved in an abortion, outlawing abortion would have a chilling effect on medical providers, as evidenced by cases in countries such as Malta and Poland where abortion is severely restricted."

Wyoming,2022,Q3,"Information and medications needed to end a pregnancy are increasingly available outside the health care system. In states that have banned abortion, some women with unwanted pregnancies are pursuing an unconventional workaround: They are “self-managing” their abortions, seeking out the necessary know-how online and obtaining the medications without the supervision of a clinic or a doctor."
Wyoming,2022,Q3,"The Senate majority leader managed to resurrect and pass a signature climate change and health care deal with help from Republican missteps.

Wyoming,2022,Q3,"Congress is known for being dysfunctional. Why hasn’t it been over the past two years? Describing Congress as dysfunctional seems unobjectionable, even clichéd.

As consumers’ whims continue to evolve in the pandemic recovery, many companies that once enjoyed high-highs are feeling the sting of low-lows. That is especially true for the exercise bike company Peloton, which reported a $1.2 billion quarterly loss on Thursday — its sixth straight quarter of losses. After a pandemic boom, Peloton is now among the many retailers struggling to sell excess inventory. But its stationary bikes, priced at $1,445 and now available on Amazon, may still be a hard sell: Other earnings reports, like those from Dollar General and Dollar Tree this week, pointed to more cautious consumer spending. The two companies, the largest dollar-store chains in the country, posted higher sales and profits in their latest quarter as inflation eats into Americans’ budgets. In the past year, a majority of new customers shopping at Dollar Tree earned at least $80,000 annually, according to the company’s chief executive — a sign that even higher earners are looking for bargains."

Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter may have closed, but his battle with the company’s board and executives seems to be barreling forward. After what DealBook hears was a bitter closing on Thursday, Musk is taunting Twitter and the law firm it worked with in its lawsuit against him, Wachtell Lipton, with the prospect of litigation, while trying to avoid paying top executives the golden parachutes they’re owed. It appears that fraught legal battles lie ahead, and it’s unclear whether Musk’s aim is to win or simply punish."

Wyoming,2023,Q1,"What happened to a state known for its political independence? The fifth season of the hit show “Yellowstone” premiered on the Sunday after the midterm elections, with Kevin Costner’s character, the rancher John Dutton, assuming Montana’s governorship. “This was never my plan,” he says, wearing a cowboy hat outside the State Capitol building in Helena. Dutton has reluctantly entered politics in part to stop an influx of rich outsiders he believes are transforming his home. In the last three years, Montana has become the second-fastest-growing state in the nation, largely because of the arrival of wealthy transplants. Unlike Dutton, many influential figures in the state’s real Republican Party have welcomed them, sometimes calling them “political refugees” fleeing blue states. Montana’s actual governor, the Republican Greg Gianforte, is himself a multimillionaire who was raised in Pennsylvania. Since assuming office in 2021, Gianforte has presided over this period of demographic change and economic growth, which has coincided with a hard shift to the right in state politics."
