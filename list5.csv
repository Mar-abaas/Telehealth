South Carolina,2022,Q3,"The lawsuit accuses President Biden of overstepping his authority in directing the government to cancel as much as $20,000 in student loan debt for millions of people.

South Carolina,2022,Q3,"The United States is rolling out a reimagined suicide prevention number to address a national mental health crisis.

South Carolina,2022,Q3,"The former mayor will serve as a visiting fellow at institutes focused on health and politics at the university this fall.

South Carolina,2022,Q4,"Many residency programs for obstetricians and gynecologists are in a risky position, caught between state abortion bans and accreditation requirements. Many medical residency programs that are educating the next generation of obstetricians and gynecologists are facing a treacherous choice."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,The commitment comes as the White House and Democrats have been focused on protecting abortion access before the midterm elections. But it is not clear if the issue is resonating with voters. WASHINGTON — President Biden said Tuesday that the first bill he would send to Capitol Hill next year if Democrats expand their control of Congress would be legislation to enshrine abortion rights into law.
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"R.S.V. has probably peaked, but flu is still surging and Covid-19 cases are rising. Scientists are hopeful next winter will be better. It has become wearyingly routine: Americans are embarking upon yet another holiday travel season in the midst of a viral onslaught."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"Maxwell Alejandro Frost focused on issues important to many young voters: gun violence, climate change, abortion rights and Medicare for all. Generation Z officially has a seat in Congress."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"Mr. Walker called the report a lie, after The Daily Beast, which has also broken news about Mr. Walker’s out-of-wedlock children, reported that a former girlfriend had the procedure in 2009. ATLANTA — Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia and an avowed abortion opponent, paid for his then-girlfriend to have an abortion in 2009, according to a report published Monday in The Daily Beast. Mr. Walker called the claim “a flat-out lie.”"
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"New data shows that the number of abortions fell by more than 10,000. In the first two months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, legal abortions nationwide declined by more than 10,000, a drop of about 6 percent, according to the first attempt at a nationwide count of abortions since the decision."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"The Black women of the United Order of Tents are scrambling to save their grand Brooklyn headquarters, and to preserve their ambitious future. On a brisk morning in November, bright yellow leaves from a huge ginkgo tree scattered onto the front yard of 87 MacDonough Street. Under peeling paint and missing cornices, Essie Gregory stood on the steps of the ramshackle mansion in the heart of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn with a small group of visitors."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"In the first major election post-Roe, Democrats tied abortion rights to everyday economics and tapped into fears about the rise of right-wing Republicans. For months, the midterm elections appeared to be a clash over rising prices, public safety worries and fears of a looming recession."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"States are turning back into “laboratories of democracy.” There are two constitutional traditions in the United States. The first is the one we all know, tied to Philadelphia and the framers, the Civil War and Reconstruction. It’s the one that structures our political system and fuels some of our most heated conflicts. The second is a little more obscure, despite the fact that it shapes as much of our political life as the first."
South Carolina,2022,Q4,"Systems throughout the nation don’t have enough teachers — especially in struggling schools. But there are many ways to address the problem. When Martisha Martin, a history teacher, moved from Broward County, Florida, to Washington, D.C., seven years ago, she chose to work at H.D. Woodson High School on the city’s impoverished eastern edge. She was drawn to the school’s commitment to strengthening urban education — and the prospect of a bigger paycheck."

South Carolina,2023,Q2,"After the G.O.P.-led legislature passed a 12-week ban, the Democratic governor vetoed the bill. The Republicans could override it, if all their members stay unified.  North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, now in the waning years of his second term, has suddenly found himself back on a campaign trail."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Friday’s victory by the United Steelworkers at a factory building electric school buses was a test for Democratic hopes that clean-energy funding from Washington could bolster organized labor. Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Focusing heavily on Florida at his first town-hall event in the Granite State, Ron DeSantis drew a reception that was sometimes warm, sometimes more skeptical — especially on the issue of abortion.

South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The 76-year-old performer canceled a Saturday performance in Charleston, S.C., for unspecified health reasons. He had resumed touring this year after canceling a series of shows in October. Jimmy Buffett, the singer-songwriter who has built a lucrative lifestyle empire on the basis of beach-bum anthems like “Margaritaville” and “It’s 5 O’Clock Somewhere,” canceled a show scheduled for Saturday in Charleston, S.C., after he was hospitalized for an unspecified illness."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Mr. Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina weighing a 2024 bid, told a questioner that the president deserves to be criticized on his policies, not his age. During a town hall on Monday at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina received a question about President Biden’s fitness for office, putting his stated desire to run a positive campaign to the test. Mr. Scott, who is expected to formally begin his presidential campaign at the end of the month, offered an answer that criticized Mr. Biden on the merits of his leadership, rather than his age or mental fitness."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The former South Carolina governor, who also served as United Nations ambassador under Donald Trump, emphasized her experience and vision. Will it be enough for her to stand out? Nikki Haley, who was the first prominent Republican to announce a challenge to former President Donald J. Trump in the 2024 race, has yet to see her presidential campaign catch fire. On Sunday night, she had a fresh opportunity to make the case for her candidacy during a 90-minute CNN town hall in prime time, in an effort to emerge from the low single digits in polls where she has been mired."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The presidential candidate went on the daytime talk show to debate his views about systemic racism. But it was his comments about L.G.B.T.Q. rights that got boos from the audience. The chatty daytime talk show “The View” might seem like an unlikely platform for Tim Scott, a senator from South Carolina and a presidential candidate, to get his footing with Republican primary voters, but he saw an opening on Monday and tried to make the most of it."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"The court split 3-3 on whether to revive a much stricter six-week limit, enacted in 2018, that was struck down before Roe v. Wade was overturned. A legal attempt to ban abortion in Iowa after six weeks of pregnancy failed on Friday, after the State Supreme Court deadlocked over whether to vacate a lower court’s injunction and allow the ban to take effect. That means abortion will remain legal in Iowa through 20 weeks of pregnancy."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors. Ten states in the past three months have passed laws prohibiting what is known as gender-affirming care for young people, in a rapid effort by Republican lawmakers across the country."
South Carolina,2023,Q2,"Mrs. Clinton cited Republican obstruction, not Ms. Feinstein’s health: Republicans would refuse to let Democrats fill her seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, she said, preventing judicial confirmations. Hillary Clinton weighed in this week on a question that has occupied Senate Democrats and much of the party at large for months: whether Senator Dianne Feinstein of California should resign in light of mounting health problems that have made it difficult for her to do her job."

South Carolina,2023,Q3,"In her stump speech, the former governor calls for common sense and experience in the White House, leaving crowds wanting more. Nikki Haley is not as loud or fiery as some of her pulpit-pounding rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.

South Carolina,2023,Q3,"After a standout college career at the University of Tennessee, she won two Olympic gold medals, played nine years in the W.N.B.A. and was the head coach at two universities. Nikki McCray-Penson, an all-American point guard for the powerhouse University of Tennessee women’s basketball team, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a three-time All-Star in the W.N.B.A., died on Friday. She was 51."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"The Florida governor has so far found little success in getting his criticism of the Trump administration’s Covid-19 policies to stick, but that has not stopped him from trying. Gov. Ron DeSantis  had hoped that his response to the coronavirus pandemic, which helped propel him to a resounding re-election in Florida last year, would produce similar results in the Republican presidential primary."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"Win or lose, Nikki Haley knows how to run. A long time ago in South Carolina, as Nikki Haley recalls when she talks to voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, she ran campaigns that nobody thought much of until, unexpectedly, suddenly, she was winning them. Is that what’s happening here? Is this real?"

South Carolina,2023,Q4,"As they vie to be the race’s Trump alternative, the two Republican rivals have been trading barbs, zeroing in on each other’s response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Once distant rivals in the 2024 presidential race, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are now locked in a heated battle to become the most viable Republican alternative to former President Donald J. Trump, seizing on the Israel-Hamas conflict to hurl broadsides at each other."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"More tenants than ever spend half or more of their income for shelter, leaving less for everything else, taking an emotional toll and leaving some without a place to call their own. To understand how rising rents punish families of modest means, look no further than the queen-size bed that Jessica Jones and her three children share in her mother’s living room, where each night brings a squirming, turning tussle for space in a house with no privacy."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"The five candidates at the third debate rejected calls for Israel to rein in its retaliation in Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. The five Republican presidential candidates on Wednesday’s debate stage gave staunch support to Israel’s invasion of Gaza, rejecting pleas to rein in the conflict and calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to destroy Hamas, the Islamic militant group that killed 1,400 civilians and Israeli soldiers in a surprise attack last month."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"Tensions hung over a trade summit in Johannesburg after the Biden administration suspended four African countries that had belonged to a program aimed at promoting economic development. As the United States seeks to deepen its relationships with African nations and counter the influence of rivals like Russia and China, it confronts a tricky question: How does it respond when countries do things that run afoul of Washington’s stated commitment to democracy and human rights?"

South Carolina,2023,Q4,"The JPMorgan Chase C.E.O.’s show of support for Ms. Haley came on the same day that a new super PAC set out to try to draw independent voters to her candidacy. The chief executive of Wall Street’s largest bank threw his support behind Nikki Haley on Wednesday, just as a group of entrepreneurs confirmed that they were forming a super PAC to try to draw independent voters to her."
South Carolina,2023,Q4,"The vice president has provided the decisive vote in the Senate 32 times, in a reflection of Democrats’ narrow majority and broader polarization in politics. Vice President Kamala Harris broke the centuries-old record on Tuesday for the most tiebreaking votes cast by a vice president in the Senate, underscoring Democrats’ tenuous hold on the majority and the deep polarization gripping Congress."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"A group of protesters chanted “Cease-fire now.” Biden supporters countered with “Four more years.” Protesters interrupted President Biden’s speech at a church in Charleston, S.C., on Monday, urging him to call for a cease-fire in Gaza."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"Some of the most contentious issues in the country will dominate the agendas of state legislatures returning to work in the coming days and weeks. As Americans have engaged in fierce disagreement over gender expression and sexual orientation, the costs and reach of racism, and the danger and opportunity presented by rapid technological advancement, state legislatures have been one of the most visible and influential arenas for these debates."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"Donald Trump is creating hurdles his allies wish he would avoid. For much of 2023, Donald Trump’s political campaign was defined by the criminal charges he faces in four jurisdictions. Republicans reacted, the former president went to arraignments and the coverage on television was often wall to wall."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"There’s no reason to imitate Chris Christie and Liz Cheney just yet. Nikki Haley lost the New Hampshire primary but found a cause: getting under Donald Trump’s not exactly rhinoceros-thick skin. The story of the Republican primary campaign in the days since Trump’s victory has been one where the victor acts like a sore loser and the likely loser loosens up, goads her stronger rival and finds a pool of small-dollar donors to keep her in the race."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"The Bodacious Belles, a women’s group in Beaufort, N.C., shows the difference a network of support can make in an aging America. Martha Barnes’s home was buzzing. It was a Saturday in little Beaufort, N.C., time to get ready for the town’s Mardi Gras parade, and women were zigzagging around the house, applying makeup, laughing and calling out repeatedly for the Fireball Cinnamon Whisky sitting on the kitchen counter."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"Republican attorneys general from 24 states said the crackdown on fine industrial particles would raise costs. The E.P.A. said it would save lives. Manufacturers and 24 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday over the Biden administration’s decision to tighten limits on fine industrial particles, one of the most common and deadliest forms of air pollution."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"The conservative gathering’s straw poll is hardly predictive, but it can show which way political winds are gusting on the far right. Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota and the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy tied for the top choice to be former President Donald J. Trump’s running mate in a straw poll on Saturday at a prominent gathering of conservative activists."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"Deployed to Djibouti, Maj. Michael Haley has missed the highs and lows of his wife’s pursuit of the White House. He is still a big presence in her campaign. When Nikki Haley conceded her deflating third-place defeat in the Iowa caucuses this month, the first person she thanked was nearly 8,000 miles away."
South Carolina,2024,Q1,Among the attendees will be the prime minister of Sweden and women who were denied an abortion and in vitro fertilization. Follow live updates on Biden’s State of the Union address.
South Carolina,2024,Q1,"What the former president says is less important than what key parts of the Republican coalition want. It is very clear that Republicans were caught off guard this month by a decision the Alabama Supreme Court issued that has jeopardized access to in vitro fertilization treatments in the state, because of its conclusion that frozen embryos are “extrauterine children” and that I.V.F. clinics can be held liable for their destruction."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"The children, who were injured or suffered malnutrition, were greeted at Kennedy Airport with toys and balloons. “These are their first memories here,” one supporter said. The four children had survived horrors in Gaza."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"Officials have shared little information, saying the outbreak was limited. But asymptomatic cows in North Carolina have changed the assessment. In the month since federal authorities announced an outbreak of bird flu on dairy farms, they have repeatedly reassured the public that the spate of infections does not impact the nation’s food or milk supply, and poses little risk to the public."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"Federal regulators said that the portable bed rails posed a serious entrapment hazard and a risk of death by asphyxiation. Medline Industries, a medical supply company, is recalling about 1.5 million portable adult bed rails in the United States and Canada after two reported deaths involving the product, federal safety regulators said."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"Also, Biden said he would be “happy to debate” Trump. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. More than 7,000 workers who make trucks and buses at Daimler Truck plants in North Carolina are poised to go on strike at midnight, barring a last-minute breakthrough. The United Automobile Workers, the union that represents the workers, said it was demanding a “historic deal” from the truck maker, including pay raises and more job security."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"Out-of-state trips for abortions more than doubled in 2023, demonstrating the upheaval in access since the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Out-of-state trips for abortions more than doubled in 2023, demonstrating the upheaval in access since the overturn of Roe v. Wade."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"The internet is awash with stories of women throwing out their oral contraception. New data suggests a different narrative. The woman in the video looks resolute, and a little sad, as she cuts up a pack of birth control pills. “These silly little pills have literally ruined me as a person,” reads the caption. The clip, which is on TikTok, has 1.1 million likes. It’s one of thousands that have proliferated on social media in recent years with virtually the same message: The pill causes terrible, sometimes irreversible side effects, and women should free themselves from it."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"The Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga is set to become the first unionized auto factory in the South not owned by one of Detroit’s Big Three. In a landmark victory for organized labor, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee have voted overwhelmingly to join the United Automobile Workers union, becoming the first nonunion auto plant in a Southern state to do so."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"Ireland will require them starting in 2026, and there are nascent efforts elsewhere to add more explicit labeling about the health risks of drinking. Fifteen words are roiling the global alcohol industry."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"The party is unifying around a blunt message that Vice President Kamala Harris pushed for privately ahead of her Friday trip to Arizona, where Democrats hope to keep Republicans reeling. In a meeting with her staff last week, Vice President Kamala Harris offered a prediction: Former President Donald J. Trump would not support a national abortion ban. Instead, she said, he would take a position that would muddy the waters on an issue that she believed could be deeply damaging for his campaign."
South Carolina,2024,Q2,"The proposal had been years in the making, in an effort to curb death rates of Black smokers targeted by Big Tobacco. In an election year, the president’s worries about support among Black voters may have influenced the postponement. The Biden administration said on Friday that it was delaying a decision on whether to ban menthol cigarettes, effectively quashing a proposal that has divided Black American voters and fueled million-dollar lobbying campaigns from the tobacco industry in this presidential election year."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"We’re covering Hurricane Helene. One of our reporters was inside the eye. Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida’s Gulf Coast as a Category 4 storm with winds of 140 miles an hour. It swallowed parts of Florida in a nine-foot storm surge, lashed the region with heavy rain and has cut power for millions of people. It is now in Georgia, where it is weakening to a tropical storm. You can track it here."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"A fierce battle with Georgia over a Medicaid experiment with stricter enrollment underscores the vast divide between parties over how to cover lower-income Americans. The Affordable Care Act was once a potent electoral issue that could swing campaigns with its more familiar moniker, Obamacare. But the 2010 health law did not factor into last week’s Republican National Convention."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"The city joins a growing number of cities and states, including New York, that are taking action to examine the effects of slavery and possible reparations. Almost 200 years after slavery officially ended in New York, the City Council passed legislation on Thursday authorizing a commission to study the devastating effects of human bondage and to develop a plan to make reparations for the harms caused."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"See the more than 150 finalists and read the top nine winning letters on hearing aids, colonialism, A.I. art and more. What’s bothering you? Who could do something about it? What could you say to persuade that person to care or to make change? How could you make us care, too?"
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"Also, rain from Debby pounded the Carolinas. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. The Harris and Trump campaigns made dueling appearances today in the same Upper Midwest cities, providing a split screen that emphasized the importance of the region in this year’s election."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,Recent infections from the Eastern equine encephalitis virus are worrying health officials. Severe cases can be deadly or leave lasting injuries. Residents of 10 communities in Massachusetts have been warned to stay indoors from dusk to dawn. Some local parks are closed at night. A person in New Hampshire has died. Pesticides are being sprayed from trucks and aircrafts.
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"The proposed contract, if approved by union members on Thursday, includes a 25 percent raise over four years and a promise to build the next plane in the Seattle-Portland area. Boeing reached a tentative deal on Sunday for a new contract with unions representing more than 33,000 workers, a significant step toward avoiding a strike that threatened to shut down production when the existing agreement expires later this week."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"Also, Hurricane Helene destroyed large swaths of the Southeast. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. The Israeli military bombed multiple residential buildings outside of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, today that it said sat on top of the central headquarters of Hezbollah. The strikes appeared to have been the most intense in the area since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began last October. Here’s the latest."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"To find a new nominee, Democrats need to hold a real contest. President Biden faces a problem with no solution. No interview or speech will convince a doubtful public that he is still fit to serve. Perceptions of him had years to harden. In June 2020, 36 percent of voters said Biden was too old to serve. By 2024, that number had roughly doubled. In the Times/Siena poll conducted in February, 73 percent said he was “too old to be an effective president.” In the April poll, 69 percent said the same. In the June poll, 70 percent. After the debate, 74 percent."
South Carolina,2024,Q3,"Researchers are only beginning to understand why some people embrace retirement while others won’t even consider it. Beth Bergmans liked working as a project manager for an online university based in Minnesota. “We are offering opportunities for people to advance in life — that brought some satisfaction,” she said. “And the people I work with are awesome.”"
South Carolina,2024,Q4,"Six days after Hurricane Helene, North Carolina was getting help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others. But officials still faced obstacles reaching some areas. In the western mountains of North Carolina outside of Asheville, the small communities of Cruso and Canton, wrecked by Hurricane Helene, were not waiting for help from the state or the federal government."
South Carolina,2024,Q4,Researchers studying bottlenose dolphins found polyester and other plastics in every animal they tested. Scientists have found plastic pollution almost everywhere they have looked. In clouds. On Mount Everest. In Arctic snow.
South Carolina,2024,Q4,"In a first, the guidelines link poor pregnancy outcomes to stroke and call on doctors to exercise greater vigilance. New guidelines for preventing strokes spell out for the first time the risks faced by women, noting that pre-term births and conditions like endometriosis and early menopause can raise the risk."

Wade reversal gave way to a coast-to-coast wave of lawsuits, legislation and pitched political fights. "
South Dakota,2022,Q2,"It may not always be clear when the kits will expire. Americans were recently offered another chance to order free at-home coronavirus testing kits through the Postal Service. But since federal and state agencies have extended the shelf lives of several brands of tests, it may not always be clear when the free kits, and others purchased separately, will expire."
South Dakota,2022,Q2,"The White House has pushed for a $22.5 billion package at home and abroad, warning about the dire consequences of inaction. But a smaller package of $10 billion has been stalled in the Senate. WASHINGTON — Lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to struggle with how to advance a pandemic aid package amid an election-year dispute over immigration, even as Congress barrels toward swift approval of $40 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine."
South Dakota,2022,Q2,"The former White House coronavirus coordinator, who became a controversial figure, said there was a consistent effort to stifle information as virus cases surged in late 2020. WASHINGTON — Dr. Deborah L. Birx, President Donald J. Trump’s coronavirus response coordinator, told a congressional committee investigating the federal pandemic response that Trump White House officials asked her to change or delete parts of the weekly guidance she sent state and local health officials, in what she described as a consistent effort to stifle information as virus cases surged in the second half of 2020."
South Dakota,2022,Q2,"On Tuesday, it was business as usual. But abortion providers, many of whom anticipated being shut down, worried about the future health and safety of their patients. On the calendar at Jackson Women’s Health Organization on Tuesday, every appointment slot was filled. Patients drove in from across Mississippi, as well as from Louisiana, Tennessee and as far away as Texas, taking the long trip to obtain an abortion from a clinic that now seemed doomed."
South Dakota,2022,Q2,The Senate candidate keeps telling puzzling stories about his poultry business. There’s a biographical story Herschel Walker tells that illustrates why so many questions linger about his Senate run in Georgia.
South Dakota,2022,Q2,The Federal Trade Commission said it would examine patterns of mergers and acquisitions to better understand how the industry became so concentrated.

South Dakota,2022,Q3,"Margot Sanger-Katz, a domestic correspondent who writes about health care for The Upshot, shares how previous reporting helped readers understand the future of abortion access in the United States. In July 2019, The Upshot, an arm of The New York Times that focuses on data-driven journalism, published the article “Where Roe v. Wade Has the Biggest Effect.” Written by the journalists Margot Sanger-Katz, Claire Cain Miller and Quoctrung Bui, the article examined what would happen if Roe v. Wade was to be overturned — Where would the number of legal abortions fall? What might happen in states with so-called trigger laws, which would ban abortion almost immediately? Using research, it estimated what could happen under various scenarios, and with maps, displayed what at that point was an alternate reality."
South Dakota,2022,Q3,"The new vaccine campaign is one of the country’s last remaining strategies, as masks have fallen away and quarantines have diminished. So far, the rollout is methodical but muted. It was vaccination time at Ethel Brown’s long-term care home in the Bronx. Again. Ms. Brown, 95, had already gotten four Covid shots, and while she was happy to submit to a fifth, this latest booster prompted a few questions."
South Dakota,2022,Q3,"Information and medications needed to end a pregnancy are increasingly available outside the health care system. In states that have banned abortion, some women with unwanted pregnancies are pursuing an unconventional workaround: They are “self-managing” their abortions, seeking out the necessary know-how online and obtaining the medications without the supervision of a clinic or a doctor."
South Dakota,2022,Q3,"An effort in Indiana to pass an abortion ban with exceptions has exposed rifts among conservatives on how to legislate in a post-Roe world. INDIANAPOLIS — Abortion opponents, especially in conservative states, had hoped to swiftly pass a new wave of restrictions after Roe v. Wade was overturned. But so far, most Republican lawmakers have moved cautiously or done nothing at all, even in statehouses where they hold overwhelming majorities."
South Dakota,2022,Q3,"The vote was mostly along party lines, with all but eight Republicans in opposition to a bill that aims to protect a right seen as newly at risk after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday passed legislation to ensure access to contraception nationwide, moving over almost unanimous Republican opposition to protect a right that is regarded as newly under threat after the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade."
South Dakota,2022,Q3,"Fetal personhood, which confers legal rights from conception, is an effort to push beyond abortion bans and classify the procedure as murder. In Georgia, it also means a $3,000 tax credit. Even as roughly half the states have moved to enact near-total bans on abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, anti-abortion activists are pushing for a long-held and more absolute goal: laws that grant fetuses the same legal rights and protections as any person."
South Dakota,2022,Q3,"Chinese and Taiwanese Americans offer varying thoughts on the House speaker’s visit. Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan this week drew concern from U.S. allies in Asia, support from Republican senators and sharp criticism from China."
South Dakota,2022,Q3,President Biden has taken pains to show that he understands there is a difference between what he calls extremist “MAGA Republicans” and other members of the Republican Party. WASHINGTON — President Biden has opened many of his recent speeches with a caveat.

South Dakota,2022,Q4,"Republicans are trying to limit the use of citizen-initiated legislation in some states after years of progressive victories.

More than 300 guests were invited to the state dinner President Biden hosted for President Emmanuel Macron of France on Thursday night, a list that included government officials, French fashion designers, a few actors, big donors and on-air personalities from MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Here is the entire list of invitees provided by the White House."

South Dakota,2023,Q2,"But advocates can’t agree on a strategy to hold more ballot initiatives. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion access has fared very well when it has appeared on the ballot."
South Dakota,2023,Q2,"With single-party statehouse control at its highest level in decades, legislators across much of the country leaned into cultural issues and bulldozed the opposition. America’s state capitals are as polarized as they have been in decades, with lawmakers imposing unflinchingly conservative or liberal agendas this year, even in politically diverse places."
South Dakota,2023,Q2,"The current and potential 2024 presidential candidates showed strong support for gun owners’ rights — a core issue for the party’s base, but one that can be a tougher sell in a general election. They cited Scripture and issued calls for prayer. They applauded law enforcement and demanded tighter security in schools. They lamented the nation’s mental health crisis and offered tough talk about the death penalty."
South Dakota,2023,Q2,"We highlight a selection of paths, overlooks and other sites in several U.S. parks that outdoor enthusiasts with disabilities can enjoy this summer. I was well into adulthood when I realized that hiking was an activity that I could participate in. I grew up with multiple disabilities and chronic illnesses and thought being “outdoorsy” was only for able-bodied people. I couldn’t find information about hiking as a disabled person, so I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out for myself."

Ron DeSantis of Florida; Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota; the former governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas; Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina; the former representative Will Hurd of Texas; Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami; and the entrepreneurs and media personalities Vivek Ramaswamy, Perry Johnson and Larry Elder."
South Dakota,2023,Q2,"What is the relationship, if any, between states requiring that abstinence is stressed in sex education and states restricting access to abortion? On July 22, 2022, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. Two weeks before this verdict, The Times Opinion section published the map above. "
South Dakota,2023,Q2,"With the right and the left up in arms about the agreement in principle reached by the president and the speaker, both sides started to make the case for its quick passage, a tall order in Congress. A day after striking a deal in principle with President Biden to suspend the debt limit, Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his leadership team began an all-out sales pitch on Sunday to rally Republicans behind a compromise that was drawing intense resistance from the hard right."

South Dakota,2023,Q3,"A popular taxidermy exhibit in Sioux Falls, S.D., was closed after the toxic substance was discovered laced throughout the specimens. Many lament the loss of the “works of art.” Usually, you go to the zoo to look at live animals. But at the Great Plains Zoo in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, people also went to see the dead ones."
South Dakota,2023,Q3,"Gov. Kim Reynolds called the Legislature for a special session to consider sweeping new restrictions on abortion. Less than a month after a deadlocked Iowa Supreme Court left a six-week abortion ban unenforceable, lawmakers returned to the State Capitol on Tuesday and passed a nearly identical set of restrictions on the procedure."
South Dakota,2023,Q3,"Donald J. Trump loomed large over the campaign trail, even though he was among the few G.O.P. contenders who stayed away from it. At a high school cafeteria in Merrimack, N.H., on Tuesday, where patriotic music blasted from the speakers and the lunch tables were decked in star-spangled napery, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota mingled with families who were digging into eggs, sausage and pancakes at a Fourth of July breakfast hosted by the local Rotary Club."
South Dakota,2023,Q4,"Post-Roe voting might bring America to a new consensus — but only if the voters keep getting their say. As long as the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, conservatives complained that it had squelched the democratic process — that unelected men in black robes had handed down a national edict rather than letting the American people sort out a consensus."

South Dakota,2024,Q1,"The minority leader’s handling of the border and foreign aid legislation drew scorching criticism from far-right Republicans, though he scored a legislative win on an issue he regards as existential and part of his legacy. Senator Mitch McConnell put his standing on the line in aggressively pursuing military assistance for Ukraine over deep Republican resistance, and he achieved the outcome he wanted: a strong Senate vote to bolster embattled U.S. allies at a critical moment."
South Dakota,2024,Q1,"Four years later, the shadow of the pandemic continues to play a profound role in voters’ pessimism and distrust amid a presidential rematch. In March 2020, when Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Donald J. Trump competed for the White House for the first time, American life became almost unrecognizable. A deadly virus and a public health lockdown remade daily routines with startling speed, leaving little time for the country to prepare."
South Dakota,2024,Q1,Travelers are racing to see parts of the world that may soon vanish. A lot of climate discussion revolves around time. Lines rise across charts predicting the next century.

South Dakota,2024,Q2,"Most strategies in the U.S. for helping people stay cool are geared toward urban areas, leaving behind vulnerable rural populations. In Caribou, Maine, a town of 7,400, the splash pad was packed with children at noon on Wednesday as temperatures soared. But next to it, at a cooling center for the rural area’s many elderly residents, all the folding chairs were empty, even though three air-conditioners were blasting a frigid breeze."
South Dakota,2024,Q2,"Gov. Kristi Noem suggested that President Biden should have euthanized the family dog, as she did. Animal experts said that such an option should be a last resort. Since late last month, Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota has been the subject of fierce bipartisan attacks for her decision to shoot and kill her family dog, a 14-month-old German wirehaired pointer named Cricket. Ms. Noem has repeatedly defended her actions, which are detailed in her forthcoming memoir, in which she says the dog was “aggressive,” “untrainable” and “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.”"
South Dakota,2024,Q2,"Also, a congressman from Texas was indicted. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. After a winter of rapid growth in the American labor market, April’s jobs numbers delivered a more mixed picture.

South Dakota,2024,Q2,"We explain why more Latino voters find Trump appealing. Many people have been surprised by the shift of Latino voters toward the Republican Party.

South Dakota,2024,Q2,"Jay Carson spent years as a Democratic insider. Disillusioned, he left politics for Hollywood and became friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — whose campaign he is now helping to steer. In his outsider bid for the White House, Robert F.

South Dakota,2024,Q3,Ten states have ballot measures to establish a right to abortion in their state constitutions. The pushback has already begun. Ballot measures on abortion rights have succeeded beyond what even their proponents imagined when the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago.
South Dakota,2024,Q3,"Infections, which can cause fever and fatigue, tend to peak in August and September. One evening in July 2003, Dr. Lyle Petersen stepped out of his home in Fort Collins, Colo., to pick up the mail. He ended up staying out longer than expected to chat with his neighbor. But when they both got bitten by mosquitoes, they rushed back indoors."
South Dakota,2024,Q3,"We explain the 10 measures that would let voters decide abortion policy in their states. If there’s one thing that captures how the abortion debate has changed in the last two years, it’s ballot initiatives. In the five decades that Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, almost every abortion question on state ballots was put there by anti-abortion groups. Now the reverse is true. In the last two years, abortion rights activists won seven out of seven ballot initiatives. So this fall, they’re swinging big, asking voters in 10 states to establish a constitutional right to abortion."
South Dakota,2024,Q3,"An investigative report, which also documents widespread sexual and physical abuse in a program of forced assimilation, calls on the federal government to apologize and “chart a road to healing.” Nearly 1,000 American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children died while attending boarding schools that were set up by the U.S. government for the purpose of erasing their tribal ties and cultural practices, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Interior Department."

South Dakota,2024,Q3,"Laws targeting gender-affirming care have uprooted thousands. But places that are more supportive can also be more expensive. When Stefanie Newell decided to move to Denver last year, the choice was about acceptance. Feeling comfortable as a transgender woman didn’t seem possible in San Antonio, her hometown, in the midst of a flood of Texas legislation targeting the L.G.B.T.Q. community."
South Dakota,2024,Q3,"Kamala Harris’s running mate was picked for his rapport with Middle America, but his progressive record as governor parallels his state’s move toward more liberal politics. When the voters of southern Minnesota shocked the Republican establishment in 2006 and elected a Democratic newcomer to represent their largely rural district, their new congressman, Tim Walz, repeatedly reached out his hand."
South Dakota,2024,Q3,"Around the country, people with a deep distrust of government want to preemptively ban the use of aerosols to reduce heat from the sun. At first glance, what happened in Tennessee’s legislature this spring seemed a bit odd."
South Dakota,2024,Q3,"The Ohio Republican has used his brief tenure in the Senate to showcase his willingness to buck party orthodoxy and articulate the MAGA case. J.D.

South Dakota,2024,Q4,"Aid agencies said that children in some areas of northern Gaza where Israel is mounting an offensive against Hamas will miss the doses, compromising the effectiveness of the campaign. Nearly 94,000 children in Gaza City received a second dose of polio vaccine this weekend in an effort that was delayed by intense Israeli bombardment and mass evacuation orders in northern Gaza, the Gazan health ministry said."
South Dakota,2024,Q4,"Residents in almost 20 states will decide on issues about gerrymanders, election rules and other voting issues. In a campaign season where the health of American democracy is hotly debated, voters in almost 20 states will get a chance to decide whether to change some of the basic rules of elections."
South Dakota,2024,Q4,"The point of placing loyalists in positions of influence isn’t to make the government work; it is to bend the government to Trump’s will. So far, the incoming Trump administration looks exactly as terrible as any reasonable person could have imagined during the campaign."
South Dakota,2024,Q4,"The president-elect’s choice of combative loyalists who could have trouble being confirmed has raised constitutional questions about executive power and the Senate’s prerogatives. President-elect Donald J. Trump’s bid to stock his cabinet with combative loyalists is creating the first major test for the new Senate Republican majority, whose leaders must now decide how far they are willing to go to challenge nominees some of them regard as egregiously unfit."
South Dakota,2024,Q4,"Rick Scott, who would have agreed to Trump’s idea of bypassing the Senate for nominations, lost his bid to become leader. There’s at least a chance now that Senate Republicans won’t lie fully prostrate before Donald Trump for the next several years. By choosing John Thune of South Dakota as their leader on Wednesday morning, Republicans made a statement that their chamber won’t necessarily be a wholly owned subsidiary of the White House and it may occasionally assert its constitutional role as a check on executive power."
South Dakota,2024,Q4,"November’s second-most-important election is in Florida. I’ll never forget the first time I heard my oldest daughter’s heartbeat. My wife was experiencing trouble in the first three months of pregnancy, and we were worried she was miscarrying. We rode together to her doctor’s office, full of anxiety. And then we heard the magical sound — the pulsing of our little girl’s tiny heart. We didn’t know if she would ultimately be OK, but there was one thing we knew: Our daughter was alive."

Tennessee,2020,Q1,"A nation ravaged by the Spanish flu figured out how to vote back then. Not without incident, but with democracy intact.

Tennessee,2020,Q3,"If medical rationing becomes necessary, some older adults are prepared to step aside. But many have the opposite concern: that they will be arbitrarily sent to the rear of the line.

The study was small and involved novice female runners, but the findings suggest that the more closely runners listen to their bodies, the more draining their running can become, both physically and psychologically. Conversely, the more runners distract themselves from what their bodies are doing as they put one foot in front of the other, the more effortless their run may feel, and the better their performance.

Tennessee,2022,Q2,"The actress Ashley Judd said in a television interview on Thursday that her mother was suffering from mental illness when she died last month. When Naomi Judd, the Grammy-winning country music singer, died last month, her daughter Ashley Judd said that she had lost her mother to the “disease of mental illness.” On Thursday, Ms. Judd was more candid, saying in a television interview that her mother had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at her home in Tennessee, and encouraging people who are distressed to seek help."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"The same rationale could also be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception, same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage. Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, laid out a vision that prompted concerns about what other rights could disappear: The same rationale that the Supreme Court used to declare there was no right to abortion, he said, should also be used to overturn cases establishing rights to contraception, same-sex consensual relations and same-sex marriage."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"Hannah Margaret Allen and Grant Schumacher chose to marry at her family’s funeral home, where “there’s a lot of life and energy,” said the groom. When Hannah Margaret Allen and Grant Joseph Schumacher met for drinks on June 7, 2019, it was his first time going on a date with someone he had met online. Ms. Allen, by her approximation, had done so 50 times by then."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"You may still be able to reduce your tax bill by contributing to an I.R.A., for instance. And if you have questions, the I.R.S. is offering free walk-in help on Saturday. After two years of extended deadlines, tax filing in April is back — and fast approaching."
Tennessee,2022,Q2,"Many of the millions of women who live in these states would be able to seek legal abortions elsewhere, but the barriers to access may be hard for some to overcome. Many of the millions of women who live in these states would be able to seek legal abortions elsewhere, but the barriers to access may be hard for some to overcome."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"The new vaccine campaign is one of the country’s last remaining strategies, as masks have fallen away and quarantines have diminished. So far, the rollout is methodical but muted. It was vaccination time at Ethel Brown’s long-term care home in the Bronx. Again. Ms. Brown, 95, had already gotten four Covid shots, and while she was happy to submit to a fifth, this latest booster prompted a few questions."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Neither piece of legislation has the votes to advance in the Senate, but Democrats intend them to draw clear lines on the issue for the midterm elections. WASHINGTON — The House on Friday passed two bills aiming at ensuring access to abortion in the post-Roe era, as Democrats seek to draw clear distinctions with Republicans on the issue heading into the midterm election campaign."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Trevon Murphy, 40, who a cousin said had a history of mental illness, was spotted by a correction officer near a Harlem park. A 40-year-old homeless man was arrested Wednesday on murder and attempted murder charges in the stabbings of three homeless men in Manhattan, one fatally, the police said. The men were all sleeping outdoors when attacked over the course of the last week."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"I could not help my mother, Naomi Judd, who lost a long battle against mental illness. I can, however, do something about how she is remembered.  April 30, 2022, was the most shattering day of my life. My beloved mother, Naomi Judd, who had come to believe that her mental illness would only get worse, never better, took her own life that day. The trauma of discovering and then holding her laboring body haunts my nights. As my family and I continue to mourn our loss, the rampant and cruel misinformation that has spread about her death, and about our relationships with her, stalks my days. The horror of it will only worsen if the details surrounding her death are disclosed by the Tennessee law that generally allows police reports, including family interviews, from closed investigations to be made public."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Even in some states where abortion remains legal, wait times for appointments are long because of increased demand. The reversal of Roe v. Wade did not affect the legal status of abortion in New Mexico, where seven clinics are still operating. But that does not mean an abortion is easy to obtain there."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Unprecedented federal aid could help schools dig out of pandemic problems — if they can figure out how to spend it in time. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, school superintendents and educators have faced impossible demands as state directives bounced between in-person and remote learning, with schools closing and opening week by week and often day by day. Once teachers’ unions, politicians and public-health advocates finally came to terms with the decision to reopen schools in the fall of 2021, battle lines shifted to whether in-person learning would require vaccinations and masks. Over the course of that school year, 18 states and the District of Columbia issued mask mandates, while 11 tried to institute bans. At least one state, Virginia, did both: Last fall, it required masks in school; by the spring, it banned requiring them. "
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"As combat sports grow in popularity, ringside physicians grapple with the precarious ethics of their role. CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — Late one Saturday evening in June, two men in their 20s stood across from each other, shirtless and swaying, in a mixed martial arts cage in Exhibit Hall B of the Chattanooga Convention Center. The mat was sticky, a dark canvas of blood and foot sweat. Something in the combatants’ eyes made them look both terrifying and terrified, wolflike and rabbitlike at once."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Voters in the Detroit suburbs said issues including the economy and bodily autonomy were driving their ballot decisions. HAZEL PARK, Mich. — Ashley Polansky, a 34-year-old retail manager, hurried inside a polling place at a tiny church to vote on Tuesday morning with one issue foremost in her mind."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"Corporal punishment had been in a slow decline before the pandemic, but remains legal in 19 states, mostly in the South. The practice makes children more aggressive and disruptive, researchers say. A Missouri school district’s announcement that it is bringing back paddling drew a lot of attention and dismay this week. But corporal punishment — with an interruption, perhaps, for the coronavirus pandemic in some places — never went away in a large number of schools."
Tennessee,2022,Q3,"The tentative deal would close an investigation by nearly three dozen states into the company’s marketing and sales practices. Juul Labs, fighting for its survival in the United States, on Tuesday tentatively agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen states over marketing and sales practices that they contend set off the nation’s teenage vaping crisis."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Vote because abortion matters. Despite Republican‌ assurances that their draconian abortion bans wouldn’t hurt women, a flood of heart-wrenching accounts from across the country prove otherwise. Yet even with that outpouring of stories, plus polls showing broad opposition to the bans and an increase in women registering to vote, it’s still unclear if the issue will be the deciding factor for voters in the midterm elections on Tuesday."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Machines that examine samples of drugs can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, but experts say they are an increasingly vital tool in stemming overdoses. CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The white powder, deposited in a small tube, arrived one morning by FedEx in a basement office on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,Proponents say the ability to check drugs for the presence of lethal fentanyl may save lives. But critics say the strips enable drug use. “You smoke weed?” Eufamia Lopez asked the half-dozen young men lounging on benches in a public housing courtyard in the South Bronx.
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Canine influenza can spread quickly through shelters, kennels and day care facilities, although most dogs will recover on their own, experts said. When a few dogs started coughing at a Texas animal shelter in October, veterinarians were not initially alarmed. The shelter, Operation Kindness, had seen its share of sick dogs."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"The trial, the first over a challenge to a state ban on gender-affirming care, concluded last week; the judge has not indicated when he will rule. LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — For Dylan Brandt, a transgender teenager in Arkansas, two years on testosterone has meant that “my outside finally matches the way I feel on the inside.”"
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Ascension, one of the country’s largest health systems, spent years cutting jobs, leaving it flat-footed when the pandemic hit. At a hospital in a Chicago suburb last winter, there were so few nurses that psychiatric patients with Covid were left waiting a full day for beds, and a single aide was on hand to assist with 32 infected patients. Nurses were so distraught about the inadequate staffing that they banded together to file formal complaints every day for more than a month."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"After Roe fell, a sleepy college town in Southern Illinois found itself to be a crucial destination for abortion access. Not all of its residents are happy about it. CARBONDALE, Ill. — There had never been an abortion clinic in the quiet college town of Carbondale, Ill. So when its first clinic opened this fall, it revealed tensions between residents that had largely been hidden."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"The Texas Public Policy Foundation is shaping laws, running influence campaigns and taking legal action in a bid to promote fossil fuels. When a lawsuit was filed to block the nation’s first major offshore wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, it appeared to be a straightforward clash between those who earn their living from the sea and others who would install turbines and underwater cables that could interfere with the harvesting of squid, fluke and other fish."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"It’s New York City. No one is here to be subtle. Here’s what some runners wore for the city’s largest block party. Before 50,000 runners are unleashed onto the streets of New York, they congregate in Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island and face an hourslong wait. In those early hours, marathon runners linger, grapple with pre-race jitters and admire what others are wearing."
Tennessee,2022,Q4,"Government oversight of sports betting offers scant consumer protections and looks to the industry to police itself, The Times found. David Hummel placed his first sports bet in January 2021, wagering $250 on the underdog in a mixed-martial-arts fight. He won $662.50, he said, “and it was probably the worst thing that could have happened to me.”"

Tennessee,2023,Q1,"The measure is part of a wave of legislation by conservative lawmakers across the country against drag performances. Many are wondering how it will be applied. NASHVILLE — A bill signed into law this week in Tennessee makes staging “adult cabaret” on public property or anywhere a child could see it a criminal offense. The law forbids performances in those places by topless, go-go or exotic dancers, strippers, or male or female impersonators who, as the law defines it, provides entertainment that is “harmful to minors.” "

Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Corrections that appeared in print on Tuesday, June 6, 2023. An article on Friday about the only Black participant in the first national spelling bee competition referred incorrectly to Zaila Avant-garde. She was the first Black American to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee, not the first Black student to do so. (Jody-Anne Maxwell of Jamaica won the bee in 1998.)"
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Critics say a fierce law-and-order approach could undermine public health goals and advances in addiction treatment. Three teenage girls were found slumped in a car in the parking lot of a rural Tennessee high school last month, hours before graduation ceremonies. Two were dead from fentanyl overdoses. The third, a 17-year-old, was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Two days later, she was charged with the girls’ murders."

Tennessee,2023,Q2,"Temperatures will be up to 20 degrees above normal for much of the region through at least the weekend, with no nighttime relief. Even for Southerners used to spending a lot of time outside, this week’s brutal heat and humidity — which spread from Texas across the Gulf Coast and north into Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas on Wednesday — are a little much."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"The key to a successful legal campaign is realizing that gender freedom benefits everyone. Transgender Americans are under attack. Across the country, Republicans have introduced an avalanche of legislation to restrict access to gender-affirming health care, censor how gender is discussed in schools, prevent trans people from using public bathrooms and even ban drag shows and cross-dressing onstage. In March, Tennessee criminalized drag performances where children are present. In April, Montana Republicans barred Representative Zooey Zephyr from the floor of the state House in part for her vocal opposition to a similar bill, which is now headed to the governor’s desk."
Tennessee,2023,Q2,"The league suspended Isaiah Rodgers and Rashod Berry of the Indianapolis Colts and Demetrius Taylor, a free agent, for at least a full season.

Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Some doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are fleeing restrictive abortion laws. Idaho has been particularly hard hit. One by one, doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are disappearing from Idaho — part of a wave of obstetricians fleeing restrictive abortion laws and a hostile state legislature. Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, a family doctor who also delivers babies in the tiny mountain town of McCall, is among those left behind, facing a lonely and uncertain future."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"So far, 24 states have eliminated sales taxes on period products that have been criticized as discriminatory.

Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Cases of severe black lung disease are back to the highest level in decades. It’s totally preventable. As a high school baseball star, Denver Hoskins led Kentucky in home runs and was invited to try out for the Cincinnati Reds. But when his father got sick (and later died) from black lung, a disease caused by inhaling mineral dust, the younger Mr. Hoskins gave up his Division I college scholarship offer to support his family. Following in his father’s footsteps, he went to work as a coal miner. By the age of 44, Mr. Hoskins was diagnosed with his own case of the most severe form of black lung. He now breathes from an oxygen tank at night and watches his son’s batting practice from the sidelines."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Gershun Freeman, 33, died last year after being stomped, punched and pinned down by the deputies in Shelby County, Tenn., his family’s lawyer said. Nine sheriff’s deputies in Memphis have been indicted in the death of a man with mental health problems who died in custody last fall after being stomped, punched and pinned down. It is the latest case to draw attention to how law enforcement responds to people in mental distress."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"With a throttle and no pedals, Super73’s new “electric balance bike” blurs the lines of regulation and safety. “No license, registration or insurance required,” its marketing promises. LeGrand Crewse, co-founder and chief executive of Super73, recently showed off the company’s latest product, a diminutive motorized bike called the K1D. Aimed at riders 4 years old and up, the vehicle lacks pedals, in the spirit of a training bicycle, and has a throttle. The company calls the K1D an “electric balance bike.”"
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"A Georgia judge who had temporarily blocked the ban put her ruling on hold after a federal court struck down an injunction on a similar law in Alabama. A federal judge in Georgia has allowed the state’s ban on gender transition care for minors to go back into full effect, after a federal appeals court panel allowed a similar law in Alabama to be enforced. Before the appellate ruling, the same judge, Sarah Geraghty, had granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked part of the Georgia ban."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Surprisingly tricky questions about an increasingly popular vehicle. E-bikes are increasingly visible on roads and bicycle paths, with a growing number of teenagers among the riders.

Here’s what’s known about e-bikes and their risks."
Tennessee,2023,Q3,"Here is a look at five expansive searches that lasted weeks, months or even years before the authorities caught their targets.

Geraghty of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Georgia on Sunday, more than a month after the ban took effect."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of the bill, which also prohibited transgender girls and women from sports teams that correspond with their gender identity, is a rare move by a Republican governor. Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, vetoed a bill on Friday that would have barred transgender minors from receiving puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries, a rare rejection in what has been a concerted effort by the Republican Party to mobilize cultural conservatives around transgender issues for the 2024 primaries."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"More than half of House Democrats declined to back the Republican-written resolution, as some argued that equating criticism of the state of Israel with hatred of the Jewish people went too far. House Democrats splintered on Tuesday over a resolution condemning the rise of antisemitism in the United States and around the world, with more than half of them declining to support a measure declaring that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism.”"

Tennessee,2023,Q4,"Each year, we ask teenagers to send us their application essays about work, money or social class. Here are four, from California to Cambodia. Some of the most basic questions about money are also central to figuring out what and who you want to be: What do I have, what do I want, how does that compare to others around me and how should I feel about it?"
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"People with the genetic disease have new opportunities to eliminate their symptoms, but the treatments come with obstacles that limit their reach. On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first gene editing therapy ever to be used in humans, for sickle cell disease, a debilitating blood disorder caused by a single mutated gene."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,Pressure builds for a pause in Gaza. The leaders of the 27 E.U. nations called yesterday for a break in the fighting in Gaza to address a dire humanitarian crisis inside the territory.

Tennessee,2023,Q4,"Some lawyers say the changes could make it more difficult to bring legal action against the company. Parents, schools and even attorneys general have increasingly been raising concerns about how TikTok may be hooking children to the app and serving them inappropriate content. But some lawyers say bringing legal action against the company could be more difficult after TikTok quietly changed its U.S. terms of service this summer."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"A number of skirmishes unfolded in Congress as tempers flared ahead of a government shutdown deadline and Thanksgiving holiday break. The former G.O.P. speaker elbowed one of the Republicans who had voted to oust him. A Republican senator rose to challenge an organized labor leader to a brawl during a hearing. Across the Capitol, the chairman of a different panel compared a member of his committee to a cartoon character."
Tennessee,2023,Q4,"A selection of stories that Times editors thought deserved more readers.

Tennessee,2024,Q1,"Lawmakers in Tennessee, Oklahoma and other Republican states want to turn the clock back to the 19th century. Most of my writing this week was on the recent elections in Iowa and New Hampshire, but most of my reading was focused elsewhere. In particular, I want to highlight this report from Jessica Valenti, published in her excellent newsletter, on proposed travel bans for abortion care in Tennessee and Oklahoma. The Tennessee ban, proposed by State Representative Jason Zachary, would make it a felony to take a minor out of state to obtain an abortion. As Valenti notes, “That means a friend, aunt or grandmother who helps a teenager get an abortion could be sent to prison for 15 years.” The Oklahoma bill, if signed into law, would punish anyone who helped a minor obtain abortion care with up to five years in prison."
Tennessee,2024,Q1,"Among his accomplishments in a four-decade career in public health, he helped pioneer programs providing bed nets in Africa. Kent Campbell, an instrumental figure in the global battle against malaria — most notably in Africa, where he led an innovative program providing bed nets to protect rural villagers from the mosquitoes carrying the disease — died on Feb. 20 in Oro Valley, Ariz., a suburb of Tucson. He was 80."

Tennessee,2024,Q1,"The governor signed a bill that prohibited the practice for children, making Wyoming the 24th state to have passed such a ban.

Tennessee,2024,Q1,The comedian Hope Woodard is spreading the word about her yearlong break from sex and dating.

Next, he declared, would be the task of organizing nonunion plants across the country."

Tennessee,2024,Q2,"Republicans tried to quash the union drive with partisanship. It didn’t work. Put yourself in the steel-toed boots of a worker at Volkswagen’s auto assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.

Tennessee,2024,Q3,"The congressional voting record of the Democrat nominee for vice president shows his liberal streak, but with a deference to a conservative district’s needs.

Tennessee,2024,Q3,"Many Americans who need therapy are discouraged by the cost. But there are options to make it more affordable. In 2019, Lydia Bugg was working from home when a man tried to break into her house. She fought off the intruder on her porch by hitting him and screaming until he ran away. Shaken by the incident, Ms. Bugg knew what she needed to do next: see a therapist."

Tennessee,2024,Q3,"Here are the telltale signs to look for in nursing homes to avoid, and resources that can point to better places. Few people want to go into a nursing home, but doing so can be the right choice if you or a loved one is physically or cognitively disabled or recovering from surgery.

Tennessee,2024,Q3,"Acadia Healthcare is holding people against their will to maximize insurance payouts, a Times investigation found.

Its stock price has more than doubled."
Tennessee,2024,Q3,"After the fall of Roe v. Wade, some clinics thought they could expand their businesses in states that still allowed them to operate. It hasn’t quite worked out that way. Providing abortion services has always been a difficult business, with tiny-to-nonexistent profit margins and often-challenging logistical obstacles. And the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson two years ago, which eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, has made the landscape of reproductive services even tougher."
Tennessee,2024,Q3,"The Senate overwhelmingly passed the Kids Online Safety Act on Tuesday, but the legislation faces an uphill battle in the House because of censorship concerns.

Tennessee,2024,Q3,"These days, getting cut off in traffic can send me on an emotional rollercoaster. So I asked experts how to get mentally tougher. I’ve noticed I am becoming less resilient as I age. Insults used to bounce off me; I could move to a new city at the drop of a hat. Now I stew for days about a social media slight and can barely change my hair without fretting."
Tennessee,2024,Q3,"In my lowest moments, I look to the people who have devoted their lives to pursuing justice no matter what. It was lying in the street, rocking gently with the turns of a placid wind. At first I thought it was some bit of detritus set free by a garbage truck, the driver hurrying to complete his rounds before the temperature reached that day’s brutal high. By the time I got close enough to see that it wasn’t any sort of trash at all, the wind had lifted it and tossed it into our yard: a blue jay’s tail feather, newly molted."
Tennessee,2024,Q3,"Flawed science helped convict Russell Maze more than 20 years ago. The D.A.’s office now says it got it wrong. Why is he still behind bars? Sunny Eaton never imagined herself working at the district attorney’s office. A former public defender, she once represented Nashville’s least powerful people, and she liked being the only person in a room willing to stand by someone when no one else would. She spent a decade building her own private practice, but in 2020, she took an unusual job as the director of the conviction-review unit in the Nashville D.A.’s office. Her assignment was to investigate past cases her office had prosecuted and identify convictions for which there was new evidence of innocence."
Tennessee,2024,Q4,"Aside from major disputes on issues like transgender rights and guns, the docket is fairly routine. That could change fast if the presidential race is contested. The new Supreme Court term, which starts as the justices return to the bench on Monday, already features cases on transgender rights, untraceable “ghost guns” and whether Mexico may sue American firearms manufacturers. The coming months may also bring voting disputes that could decide the presidential election."

Tennessee,2024,Q4,"A new analysis shows how many women in states with bans are seeking procedures or pills from out-of-state providers.

Wade."
Tennessee,2024,Q4,"The Biltmore, a popular destination in the area of western North Carolina ravaged by Hurricane Helene, will reopen Saturday. Local travel operators nervously hope it will mark the return of tourists. A little more than a month after the remnants of Hurricane Helene killed residents, destroyed homes and businesses, and felled thousands of trees in western North Carolina, workers at the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C., got a round of applause Wednesday when they stood a tree up — a 28-foot Fraser fir that will be one of 57 Christmas trees displayed this holiday season in the estate’s 19th-century mansion."

Tennessee,2024,Q4,"The progressive stronghold in California plans to target large encampments, relying on a Supreme Court decision handed down by a conservative majority. Berkeley, Calif., long associated with the counterculture of the 1960s, has a reputation for erring on the side of compassion when it comes to addressing drug use and homelessness. The city is such a liberal outlier that Vice President Kamala Harris downplayed her origins there as she tried to appeal to moderate American voters this year."
Tennessee,2024,Q4,"The president-elect held his first formal transition meetings and has been given lists of candidates, but is calling around to friends and allies for ideas.

Texas,2020,Q1,"The Texas Republican isolated himself after possible exposure to the coronavirus. If only others in his party took the threat as seriously.

Texas,2020,Q1,"Democrats and the House of Representatives had urged the court to act in time to decide their appeals by the end of the court’s term in June. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a request from Democratic state officials and the House of Representatives to quickly consider whether to hear an appeal of a decision with the potential to wipe out the entire Affordable Care Act.

Texas,2020,Q2,"The state wanted to be among the first to reopen. It’s now dealing with the consequences. HOUSTON — For one brief, delusional moment in early April, I felt a smidgen of support for my governor, Greg Abbott.

She must make sure nobody finds out where she lives."
Texas,2021,Q4,"A Texas statute that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy was seemingly undercut by two court rulings, but the reality on the ground has not changed. HOUSTON — Within the span of a few hours, a Texas judge and the U.S. Supreme Court appeared to undercut Texas’ six-week abortion ban, ruling in separate opinions late Thursday and early Friday that aspects of the law were unconstitutional under state law and that federal challenges could go forward."
Texas,2022,Q1,"With the Biden administration’s attempt to impose a national standard blocked, companies must navigate a thicket of local rules as they try to return employees to the workplace. The Biden administration’s attempt to impose a sweeping vaccine rule for private employers last year was met with a wave of state laws limiting company vaccine mandates. Texas and Florida were on the vanguard of that backlash."
Texas,2022,Q1,"New data suggests overall abortions declined much less than previously known, because women traveled out of state or ordered pills online. In the months after Texas banned all but the earliest abortions in September, the number of legal abortions in the state fell by about half. But two new studies suggest the total number among Texas women fell by far less — around 10 percent — because of large increases in the number of Texans who traveled to a clinic in a nearby state or ordered abortion pills online."
Texas,2022,Q1,"The announcement came hours after two men had been arrested in Britain as part of an investigation by counterterrorism officers in which several people have been questioned.

Texas,2022,Q1,"Citigroup is the first major U.S. bank to announce a policy change in response to the legislation, which bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.

Texas,2022,Q1,"A judge said the governor’s order to consider medically accepted treatments for transgender youth as abuse had been improperly adopted and violated the State Constitution. HOUSTON — Investigations of parents with transgender children for possible child abuse were temporarily halted across Texas on Friday after a state court ruled that the policy, ordered last month by Gov. Greg Abbott, had been improperly adopted and violated the State Constitution."
Texas,2022,Q1,"In this lesson, students will learn about Gov. Greg Abbott’s move to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse.

It seems like psychedelics — though mostly still illegal — are everywhere."
Texas,2022,Q1,"In the Laredo region, long a Democratic stronghold, that single issue appears to be driving the decision for many voters, the majority of whom are Catholic. LAREDO, Texas — Like the majority of her neighbors in the heavily Latino community of Laredo, Angelica Garza has voted for Democrats for most of her adult life. Her longtime congressman, Henry Cuellar, with his moderate views and opposition to abortion, made it an easy choice, she said."
Texas,2022,Q1,"In her second run for Congress, Jessica Cisneros has moved from pitching progressive policies to attacking the incumbent Democrat, Representative Henry Cuellar. LAREDO, Texas — Two years ago, a 26-year-old immigration lawyer named Jessica Cisneros came within 3.6 percentage points of pushing out the longtime Democratic congressman here, running aggressively on the progressive vision of the national liberals who had bankrolled her insurgent campaign."
Texas,2022,Q1,"One family was affected by the decision, but Gov. Greg Abbott’s order to investigate certain medically accepted treatments as child abuse is still in place. HOUSTON — A state court in Texas on Wednesday temporarily halted the child abuse investigation of a family providing medical treatment for its transgender 16-year-old, but allowed other investigations to continue under a contentious policy initiated last week by Gov. Greg Abbott."
Texas,2022,Q2,"The victory by Representative Henry Cuellar notched a narrow win for moderate Democrats who saw the race as a proxy battle over the party’s broader direction. Henry Cuellar, the embattled nine-term congressman from South Texas in the political fight of his career, won his Democratic primary runoff against a young progressive opponent, overcoming fierce attacks on his record and an F.B.I. investigation with a last-minute push from top national Democrats."
Texas,2022,Q2,"The law, prompted by complaints from conservatives, allows people to sue large online platforms that remove posts expressing a particular viewpoint. A Texas law prohibiting large social media companies from removing political speech became the first of its kind to take effect on Wednesday, posing complicated questions for major web platforms about how to comply with the rules."
Texas,2022,Q2,"New safety inspections are part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s effort to crack down on border smuggling. But industry groups say it is stifling trade.

Texas,2022,Q2,"Technically, the border is closed to most migrants under a 2020 order. But the policy, known as Title 42, has had the unintended effect of encouraging people to repeatedly attempt to cross the border. Responding to news of the migrant deaths near the southern Texas border, Gov. Greg Abbott pointed the blame at what he said were President Biden’s “open border policies.”"
Texas,2022,Q2,"Since the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, his hometown, Mr. O’Rourke has pushed for stricter gun safety. It hasn’t helped him politically — but that’s not his point. DALLAS — To loud cheers in a community gym on Wednesday evening, Beto O’Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso and the Democratic candidate for governor of Texas, renewed his criticism of Gov. Greg Abbott over the state’s gun laws, which he said allowed an 18-year-old in Uvalde to slaughter 19 students and two teachers with a legally and easily acquired military-style weapon."
Texas,2022,Q2,The district in the border city of Brownsville has sent Democrats to Congress for years. A U.S. House district in South Texas will send a Republican to Congress for the first time in its 10-year history. 
Texas,2022,Q2,"Online hoax allegations are an insult to family members and should be taken down. It’s almost impossible to comprehend what to do in the wake of mass shootings like the one that killed 19 schoolchildren and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, this week. While there are lots of words — you can listen to my discussion on “Sway” with Nicholas Kristof and Frank Smyth on where we go next on gun control — it can leave an empty feeling, as the sense of hopelessness overwhelms our ability to understand how we got here. The problem is exacerbated by the perpetrators’ use of online tools, which some have used to float phony conspiracy theories."
Texas,2022,Q2,"Under a public health rule known as Title 42, thousands of migrants have been expelled at the border. A federal judge is halting efforts to begin lifting the policy, due to end on May 23. A federal judge on Monday said he would block the Biden administration from exempting migrants from expulsion under a Trump-era public health order until the policy is officially lifted next month."
Texas,2022,Q2,"Mass shootings and other types of trauma can have ripple effects not only for survivors but also for those who follow the news of the events. Heather Martin was a senior at Columbine High School in 1999 when two gunmen, also teenagers, killed 13 people and wounded 21 more before taking their own lives. She ended up barricaded in a room for three hours. And although she wasn’t physically injured, she witnessed the aftermath of the shooting, which she described as “horrifying.”"

Texas,2022,Q3,"Lever Alejos, who was delivered to the nation’s capital courtesy of Gov. Greg Abbott, has found plenty of work. ‘I feel fortunate the governor put me on a bus to Washington.’ When Lever Alejos of Venezuela arrived at the southern border penniless in July, he gladly accepted a free bus ride to Washington, D.C., courtesy of the state of Texas. He had no family or friends to receive him, and spent one night in the plaza across from Union Station. He soon settled into a homeless shelter."

It was the first such death in the state’s history and the second in the Midwest this summer."

Greg Abbott, the Republican incumbent, in the tightening contest."
Texas,2022,Q3,"Texas has been hit with an unrelenting heat wave. Nowhere is it more miserable than in low-income areas that have less access to shade and air-conditioning. SAN ANTONIO — One day last week, Juanita Cruz-Perez poked her head out the back door of her two-bedroom home in San Antonio and shook her head no. It wasn’t quite noon yet, and the heat was already unbearable. She opened the front and back doors, praying for any kind of breeze, and turned on a plastic fan that sputtered hot air. She resisted the temptation to turn on the power-guzzling air-conditioner."
Texas,2022,Q3,"The National Health Service is closing England’s sole youth gender clinic, which had been criticized for long wait times and inadequate services.

Wade in June."
Texas,2022,Q4,"The play’s author, who is Black, said he crafted its language to be historically accurate in representing civil rights struggles. But the theater program at the university heeded the call of students. Texas Wesleyan University halted its production of “Down In Mississippi,” a play about registering voters in the 1960s, after criticism from students who said racist epithets in the script could contribute to a hostile, unwelcoming environment. Its author said he was using that language to represent the reality of the period."
Texas,2022,Q4,About 130 migrants from Texas were bused to the vice president’s home on one of the coldest Christmas Eves on record in the nation’s capital. Dec. 26: This article was updated with a statement from the office of Governor Greg Abbott of Texas.
Texas,2022,Q4,"The Texas Public Policy Foundation is shaping laws, running influence campaigns and taking legal action in a bid to promote fossil fuels. When a lawsuit was filed to block the nation’s first major offshore wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, it appeared to be a straightforward clash between those who earn their living from the sea and others who would install turbines and underwater cables that could interfere with the harvesting of squid, fluke and other fish."
Texas,2022,Q4,"Beyond making tough moments a little easier, cultivating levity is good for your health. Wendi Aarons was writing at her local library when the sound of an angry voice made everyone look up. A patron, outraged over a book policy, vowed to take her child to another library and stormed off after berating the staff. The entire room was “so upset,” recalled Ms. Aarons, a humorist in Austin, Texas. “It was just this awful, uncomfortable silence.”"
Texas,2022,Q4,"Flu cases are higher than usual for this time of year and are expected to soar in the coming weeks. Another virus, R.S.V., already is straining pediatric hospitals in some states. For more than two years, shuttered schools and offices, social distancing and masks granted Americans a reprieve from flu and most other respiratory infections. This winter is likely to be different."
Texas,2022,Q4,"A new study confirms that you don’t have to do a hard workout to reap the longevity rewards of exercise. Dashing up the stairs to your apartment, weaving between commuters as you dart toward the train — those small snippets of exercise, if they’re intense enough, can add up, according to a new study. The paper is among the first to examine what many exercise scientists have long hypothesized: A little bit of physical activity goes a long way, even movement you might not consider a workout."

A Texas man was arrested on Friday on a federal charge that he left a voice mail message threatening to kill a Boston doctor who provides care to gender nonconforming children, the authorities said."
Texas,2022,Q4,"An estimated seven people have died from Vibrio vulnificus.

After more than two decades of pleas from conservation groups, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Thursday announced protections for the lesser prairie chicken, a flamboyant, stocky bird that once covered America’s grasslands in the hundreds of thousands but whose population has since dwindled to roughly 30,000."
Texas,2023,Q1,"A ruling by a federal judge this week could set up yet another Supreme Court challenge to the Obamacare health law.

Texas,2023,Q2,"If this isn’t what anti-abortion groups want, why won’t they fix it? It’s increasingly clear that it’s not safe to be pregnant in states with total abortion bans. Since the end of Roe v. Wade, there has been a barrage of gutting stories about women in prohibition states denied care for miscarriages or forced to continue nonviable pregnancies. Though some in the anti-abortion movement publicly justify this sort of treatment, others have responded with a combination of denial, deflection and conspiracy theorizing."
Texas,2023,Q2,"The tornado destroyed a trailer park as it pummeled the Texas Panhandle city of Perryton. At least 75 people were injured, the authorities said. A storm system that swept through Texas on Thursday evening killed three people and injured dozens of others, an official said, as the state braced for a weekend of brutal heat."
Texas,2023,Q2,"Democrats and abortion-rights leaders said the decision could be a catastrophe and used the moment to criticize Republicans, who remained relatively quiet on Friday. As Americans digested a Texas judge’s ruling on Friday night invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone — and a contradictory ruling from a Washington State judge ordering the F.D.A. to maintain its approval as is in some states — the divide in political reactions was as much between words and silence as it was between pro- and anti-abortion rights."
Texas,2023,Q2,"A federal judge’s decision to invalidate the F.D.A.’s approval of mifepristone could affect availability even in states where abortion is legal. The governor of Massachusetts has asked the University of Massachusetts to purchase a one-year supply of the abortion pill mifepristone, and issued an executive order shielding pharmacists who stock the drug, abortion providers and patients from criminal and civil liability."
Texas,2023,Q2,"A record-breaking heat wave is expected to worsen through the weekend as it spreads through nearby states.

Texas,2023,Q2,"A new law pre-empting local labor rules is part of an effort by Republicans in the Capitol to exert control over the state’s Democratic-led major cities. As the heat index hit 115 degrees on Monday, Karla Perez took a five-minute water break at a construction site in Dallas. Such rest breaks are required by the city, as they are in Austin."
Texas,2023,Q2,"Gov. Greg Abbott is expanding state law enforcement on the border as some state leaders appear eager to test the waters on how far Texas can go in enforcing immigration law. AUSTIN, Texas — Four C-130 military transport planes towered over the tarmac at Austin’s international airport, idling with the doors open as the sun rose over a news conference called by the Texas governor, Greg Abbott."
Texas,2023,Q2,"The building conflict between moderates and hard-liners in one of the Republican Party’s most important states highlights tension over the future of the party. The impeachment of the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, by a majority of his fellow Republicans has exposed an undercurrent of division and discontent that is roiling the Republican Party in the most populous state where it still enjoys near total political control."
Texas,2023,Q2,"Four C-130 military transport planes towered over the tarmac at the international airport in Austin, Texas, idling with the doors open as the sun rose over a news conference called by the state’s governor, Greg Abbott.

Texas,2023,Q2,"The DACA program has shielded hundreds of thousands of young adults from deportation, but they have not been able to access federal health insurance programs. WASHINGTON — President Biden on Thursday said his administration would expand health care coverage for nearly 600,000 immigrants who were brought to the country as children and are protected from deportation."
Texas,2023,Q3,"A “hold-the-line” operation has created tensions with federal agents who warn it could lead to more drownings. Officers ordered to carry out the measures are raising alarms. For more than two years, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has pursued an increasingly aggressive approach to the border, sending thousands of National Guard troops and police officers to patrol the Rio Grande and testing the legal limits of state action on immigration."
Texas,2023,Q3,"A fifth bus arrived in the city last weekend, bringing the number of migrants who have been transported since June to 199. Something many people have criticized as a political stunt playing out elsewhere in the country arrived in Southern California starting in mid-June."
Texas,2023,Q3,"The death appeared to be the first linked to Gov. Greg Abbott’s program of sending migrants from the border to Democratic-run cities. A 3-year-old child died while traveling on a bus chartered by the state of Texas as it transported asylum seekers from the border city of Brownsville to Chicago as part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s program to send migrants from Texas to Democratic-run cities in other states, officials said."
Texas,2023,Q3,"The Kentucky Republican said he would finish his term as leader, which runs through 2024, and in the Senate, where he was elected to serve through 2026. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the longtime Republican leader whose recent medical episodes have raised questions about his ability to continue steering his party in the Senate, declared on Wednesday that he had no intention of relinquishing his top post or leaving Congress ahead of schedule."
Texas,2023,Q3,"The men are considered the leading candidates to replace the top Senate Republican, should he be forced to step aside for health reasons. Senator Mitch McConnell’s second alarming medical episode before television cameras on Wednesday has renewed scrutiny on his health as well as speculation about possible replacements for the longtime leader should he be forced to step aside."
Texas,2023,Q3,"Medical device makers have bankrolled a cottage industry of doctors and clinics that perform artery-clearing procedures that can lead to amputations. Kelly Hanna’s leg was amputated on a summer day in 2020, after a Michigan doctor who called himself the “leg saver” had damaged her arteries by snaking metal wires through them to clear away plaque."
Texas,2023,Q3,"Extreme heat is the engine of planetary chaos. We ignore it at our peril. In 2019, I happened to be visiting Phoenix on a 115-degree day. I had a meeting one afternoon about 10 blocks from the hotel where I was staying downtown. I gamely thought I’d brave the heat and walk to it. How bad could the heat really be? I grew up in California, not the Arctic. I thought I knew heat. I was wrong. After walking three blocks, I felt dizzy. After seven blocks, my heart was pounding. After 10 blocks, I thought I was a goner."
Texas,2023,Q3,"His designer was taken aback. But then she set about creating “Lenny Kravitz meets Italian ’60s meets ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.’” When Kirk Ferguson asked Sara Story to design the interiors of his new house in Austin, Texas, his request was unlike any she had heard before."
Texas,2023,Q3,"With the Senate returning from its long summer recess, the minority leader circulated a note from the congressional doctor saying an examination and tests showed no signs of a stroke or seizure. Hoping to reassure his colleagues that he is physically able to continue as minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell released a letter on Tuesday from the attending physician of Congress declaring that an examination and tests had ruled out a stroke or seizure as causes of his recent on-camera medical episodes."
Texas,2023,Q3,"The minority leader’s health episode at the Capitol has intensified talk about a possible succession, a prospect that his colleagues have not seriously grappled with for years. It has been decades since there was any real uncertainty at the top of the Republican Party in the Senate. But Senator Mitch McConnell’s alarming freeze-up at a news conference on Wednesday at the Capitol, as well as new disclosures about other recent falls, have shaken his colleagues and intensified quiet discussion about how long he can stay in his position as minority leader, and whether change is coming at the top."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Lubbock County, home to more than 300,000 near the New Mexico border, has become the fourth and largest Texas county to bar travel assistance for abortions. In recent months, abortion opponents in Texas have succeeded in passing a growing number of local ordinances to prevent people from helping women travel to have abortions in nearby states that still allow the procedure."
Texas,2023,Q4,"A state court judge said a woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition could legally obtain an abortion despite the state’s bans. A Texas judge granted a request on Thursday to allow an abortion despite the state’s strict bans, ruling in the case of a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Known as curanderas, they carry on a tradition long revered in local Hispanic culture. On a recent day, Chriselda Hernandez heard a knock at her door in the Texas border town of Edinburg. It was a college student who said she was suffering from a string of bad luck. A drunken driver had crashed into her car. Then someone broke into the new car she was driving and stole her laptop. “I need a limpia,” she pleaded — a spiritual cleanse."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Abortion politics are threatening a successful global AIDS program. For decades, the U.S. has bankrolled global efforts to fight the spread of AIDS, saving tens of millions of lives. Congress has extended the program on a bipartisan basis since President George W. Bush created it in 2003."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Also, attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, signed into law today a measure empowering the state’s police to arrest migrants who enter the state from Mexico without authorization. The legislation, which takes effect in March, is expected to set up a court fight between Texas and the federal government over immigration enforcement powers."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Also, Israeli evidence of Hamas operations. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. Despite Texas’ strict ban on abortion, a judge there ruled today that Kate Cox, whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, could terminate her 20-week pregnancy. Her case is believed to be among the first attempts to seek a court-approved abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Xavier Becerra, the health and human services secretary, suggested that states were doing far too little to make sure that children were not unfairly denied federal insurance. The Biden administration on Monday warned the governors of nine states of unusually high Medicaid coverage losses among children, suggesting that officials were failing to protect young, low-income Americans while winnowing the program’s rolls."
Texas,2023,Q4,It’s very hard to determine when an abortion is medically necessary. Many people were shocked when the Texas Supreme Court intervened recently to stop Kate Cox from getting an abortion in the state — an abortion needed to protect her health and future fertility after her fetus was diagnosed with a severe fetal anomaly in her second trimester. She ultimately traveled out of state to get the abortion she needed.
Texas,2023,Q4,"Five months into her tenure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Mandy K. Cohen is trying to put a human face on public health. Dr. Mandy K. Cohen dropped by the Fox affiliate in Dallas in November, just days after the governor of Texas signed a law barring private employers from requiring Covid-19 shots. If she thought promoting vaccination would be a tough sell in a ruby-red state, Dr. Cohen, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not give any indication."
Texas,2023,Q4,"Hundreds of migrants have ended up needing extensive treatment in U.S. hospitals after trying to scale barriers along the southern border. Ambulances rush them daily to hospitals in El Paso, San Diego and Tucson, Ariz., writhing in pain — bones poking out of arms and legs; skulls cracked; spines shattered. The men and women arrive on stretchers flanked by an agent in the telltale green uniform of the U.S. Border Patrol."
Texas,2024,Q1,"Record numbers of cases of the mosquito-borne virus have been reported in the Southern Hemisphere summer, and the surge is likely to move north. Brazil is experiencing an enormous outbreak of dengue fever, the sometimes fatal mosquito-borne disease, and public health experts say it is a harbinger of a coming surge in cases in the Americas, including Puerto Rico."
Texas,2024,Q1,"The Dallas-area congressman presented himself as an across-the-aisle politician who could appeal to a wide range of voters. Representative Colin Allred, a Dallas-area Democrat who defeated an incumbent Republican in 2018 to gain his congressional seat, won the Democratic primary race for the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, emerging on top of a crowded field seeking to challenge Senator Ted Cruz."
Texas,2024,Q1,"The hacking shut down the nation’s biggest health care payment system, causing financial chaos that affected a broad spectrum ranging from large hospitals to single-doctor practices. An urgent care chain in Ohio may be forced to stop paying rent and other bills to cover salaries. In Florida, a cancer center is racing to find money for chemotherapy drugs to avoid delaying critical treatments for its patients.

President Biden said on Tuesday that Uber and Lyft, two of the country’s largest ride-sharing services, would provide free rides to vaccination sites beginning May 24, an agreement intended to help stem the declining pace of immunizations and reach his goal of at least partly inoculating 70 percent of American adults by July 4."
Utah,2021,Q2,"At a Senate hearing on the federal government’s pandemic response, Republicans criticized the government’s guidance for cruise ships, fishermen, summer camps and outdoor mask wearing. WASHINGTON — The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday defended the agency against accusations that federal scientists were being too slow to update their pandemic-control guidance and overly conservative with their recommendations, especially on outdoor mask wearing."
Utah,2021,Q2,"Jonathan Frostick, a program manager at an investment bank, was still in the hospital when he wrote a LinkedIn post vowing to step away from work and spend more time with his family. Thousands responded. As he sat at his computer on a recent Sunday afternoon preparing for the workweek ahead, Jonathan Frostick, a program manager at an investment bank in London, said he could not breathe. His chest tightened and his ears started to pop. He was having a heart attack."

Utah,2021,Q3,"With some health care workers still refusing to be immunized, medical centers around the country are requiring shots as cases climb once again. More and more hospitals and major health systems are requiring employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, citing rising caseloads fueled by the Delta variant and stubbornly low vaccination rates in their communities and even within their work force."

Utah,2021,Q3,"Gabrielle Petito and her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, left on July 2 for an adventure in their outfitted van. Now, the police say, she is missing and her fiancé is “a person of interest” in her disappearance.

Utah,2021,Q3,"New coronavirus cases have been rising across the United States, though cases, hospitalizations and deaths remain a fraction of their peaks.

Utah,2021,Q3,"A study that followed essential workers in six states found that vaccine protection dropped from 91 percent to 66 percent, still a “really high number,” one scientist said. Coronavirus vaccines provided strong protection against infection for essential workers earlier this year, but became less effective as the highly contagious Delta variant became the dominant form of the virus, according to a study published on Tuesday by federal health officials."
Utah,2021,Q3,"Frustrated by the prospect of a new surge, many Americans are blaming the unvaccinated. A tougher stance may backfire, some experts warn. As coronavirus cases resurge across the country, many inoculated Americans are losing patience with vaccine holdouts who, they say, are neglecting a civic duty or clinging to conspiracy theories and misinformation even as new patients arrive in emergency rooms and the nation renews mask advisories."
Utah,2021,Q3,"Vaccine uptake has risen from early-summer lows all over the United States, and the upswing is especially pronounced in places that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic’s fourth wave.

Utah,2021,Q4,"With fewer Covid protocols at many resorts, guests can expect shorter lift lines and less outdoor masking. But policies differ, depending on the area, so know before you go. Early last February, Michelle Harris, a physical therapist from Erie, Colo., planned a weeklong ski trip to Jackson Hole, Wyo., later in the month. She knew she needed to make reservations with her Ikon Pass, but when she checked online, all the February slots were already booked, thanks to pandemic-induced capacity restrictions and a particularly snowy February. Ms. Harris went anyway, knowing she had a place to stay with friends and intending to backcountry ski near Jackson until a last-minute spot to ride the lifts opened up."
Utah,2021,Q4,"For most of us, exercise impacts our hunger and weight in unexpected and sometimes contradictory ways. Does being active make us ravenous afterward and prone to eating more than we perhaps should? Or does it blunt our appetites and make it easier for us to skip that last, tempting slice of pie?"
Utah,2021,Q4,"The N.F.L. has very little wiggle room in its regular season and playoffs. And universities are reshuffling their college basketball teams as the College Football Playoff and bowl games near. The N.F.L. on Friday postponed three games that were slated for this weekend, the latest juggling of sports schedules as scores of college and professional athletes and coaches have tested positive for the coronavirus in the pandemic’s latest surge."
Utah,2021,Q4,"The looming wave is shaking the rickety infrastructure that has kept schools running. This is our final Education Briefing newsletter for 2021 — and it’s sobering to have to end the year with a look at another wave of Covid, and the toll on the mental health of our students."
Utah,2021,Q4,"Since vaccines became widely available in April, nearly 250,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States. Their demographics are different from earlier in the pandemic.

Utah,2021,Q4,"A coronavirus outbreak across the league has cast a shadow over Saturday’s highlight slate of games, with several key players unavailable to compete. The N.B.A. has long looked to Christmas Day as a highlight of the young season, a made-for-TV spectacle that brings together many of the best teams and best players for a daylong extravaganza of basketball fireworks."
Utah,2021,Q4,"With cases of the Omicron variant rising in Europe, there are worries that even tougher restrictions are looming over a holiday period that many had hoped would be a return to some normalcy. LONDON — Confirmed cases of the Omicron variant surged in Britain and Denmark on Sunday, backing up scientists’ fears that it has already spread more widely despite travel bans and adding to worries of new lockdowns before the holidays."
Utah,2021,Q4,"The research may help explain why people who are overweight and obese have been at higher risk of severe illness and death from Covid. From the start of the pandemic, the coronavirus seemed to target people carrying extra pounds. Patients who were overweight or obese were more likely to develop severe Covid-19 and more likely to die."
Utah,2021,Q4,"More states are finding cases of the new variant. Tracking its spread, experts say, is key to understanding what threat it poses. OMAHA — Researchers in Nebraska had just finished sequencing six samples of the Omicron variant, the most discovered anywhere in the United States. They just didn’t know it yet."
Utah,2021,Q4,"Experts and tribal leaders aren’t sure why, but living near communities with low vaccination rates may be contributing. The Navajo Nation managed to tame Covid-19 earlier this year, mounting a campaign that drove its vaccination rate far above the United States average, after the virus ravaged the Navajo people."
Utah,2022,Q1,"Mink farms threaten to become a source of new coronavirus variants — and an object lesson in how ‘spillback’ can make deadly diseases even deadlier. A mink farm in northern Utah sat at the end of a narrow, rutted road lined by modest, densely packed ranch houses. The farm consisted of a grassy lot partly enclosed by stakes with wire wrapped haphazardly around them and a small, chain-link swing gate. Long, narrow mink sheds a few yards beyond the gate were so close to the road that I could see inside their dark interiors."
Utah,2022,Q1,"It isn’t as easy as it once was to find a dazzling night sky. In search of the Milky Way, our writer headed to Utah, which has the densest concentration of designated Dark Sky places in the world. At 4:30 a.m. on Jan. 17, 1994, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake caused a citywide power outage in Los Angeles. I lived there at the time and was among the many Angelenos who made their way outside, looked up and found a spectacular sight: a vast blanket of stars that had been blotted out for generations by light pollution. It was reported that some people were so bewildered by the diaphanous Milky Way, they called 911 and the Griffith Observatory to report strange, unidentified objects in the sky. I only remember being awe-struck."

Utah,2022,Q1,"It never quite fit in your wallet, so it’s no surprise you may have misplaced it by now. More than a year ago, when Covid-19 vaccines became available and jabs started going into arms, it became a point of pride for some people to show off a bandaged shoulder and a white Covid-19 Vaccination Record card."
Utah,2022,Q1,"The overall pattern is familiar, but a fresh perspective on how to interpret cases, hospitalizations and deaths is necessary as Omicron tears through the country.

Testing in remote ranching towns. Funds fortifying the Arizona county’s strained health department."
Utah,2022,Q1,"The need for healthy, active grandparents who can help with child-rearing may be encoded in our genes. Why is physical activity so good for us as we age? According to a novel new theory about exercise, evolution and aging, the answer lies, in part, in our ancestral need for grandparents."
Utah,2022,Q1,"Tracking the virus in wastewater is helping some cities and hospitals respond to the most recent wave of the coronavirus, but a more coordinated national effort is needed, experts say. As the highly contagious Omicron variant pushes national coronavirus case numbers to record highs and sends hospitals across the country into crisis mode, public health officials are eagerly searching for an indication of how long this surge might last."
Utah,2022,Q2,"Overcoming poverty and representing Utah, he became a powerful figure in Washington, helping to build a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who crusaded for conservative causes and outlasted six presidents in a seven-term Senate career that corresponded to the rise of a right-wing movement in America, died on Saturday in Salt Lake City. He was 88."
Utah,2022,Q2,"Hospitalizations remain low, partly a reflection of greater immunity in the population. Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are rising in a majority of American states, in what appears to be the first widespread increase since the peak of the Omicron surge in January."

Utah,2022,Q2,"The State Legislature, which is dominated by Republicans, may override the veto.

Utah,2022,Q2,"White House officials said recently they would repurpose $10 billion in federal funds meant for virus testing and protective gear and instead spend the money on antiviral drugs and vaccines. WASHINGTON — The Republican senator who had been leading negotiations with the White House over new pandemic relief funding accused the Biden administration on Thursday of giving him “patently false” information when it said it was out of money to buy more coronavirus vaccines and treatments, in a tense exchange that appeared to further dim the chances of Congress approving new funds."
Utah,2022,Q2,"Research suggests there may be an ideal number of close friends we should have. What is that number for you? Today, you will read about studies that try to identify the optimal number of close friends a person should have in order to feel connected and happy.

Utah,2022,Q2,"Around the country, a patchwork of laws was taking hold amid protest and celebration. A new and rapidly shifting reality took hold across America on Saturday as abortion, a basic legal right for nearly a half century, was outlawed in some states, and the initial bursts of elation and shock from the overturning of Roe v. Wade gave way to action."
Utah,2022,Q2,"After leaving the labor force in unusual numbers early in the pandemic, Americans approaching retirement age are back on the job at previous levels. When Kim Williams and millions of other older Americans lost their jobs early in the coronavirus pandemic, economists wondered how many would ever work again — and how that loss would weigh on the economy for years to come."
Utah,2022,Q3,"Abortion was illegal after six weeks of pregnancy, but a judge put the law on hold after abortion rights advocates sued the state. An Ohio judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the state’s ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, saying that the right to abortion is protected under the state’s Constitution."
Utah,2022,Q3,"New federal data outline the scale of suffering among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Carol Schumacher, 56, who was raised in the remote community of Chilchinbeto in the Navajo Nation, has lost 42 family members to Covid-19 over the last two years.

Utah,2022,Q3,"As anxiety and depression soar among adolescents, researchers struggle to understand how exactly social media affects mental health. Puberty hit C early — in the fourth grade — and hard: acne, breasts, attention, humiliation. C found refuge in the internet."
Utah,2022,Q3,"Concerned about losing access to pregnancy care, and fearful of legal consequences, surrogates and those who work with them are rewriting contracts and changing the way they operate. During her 20-week pregnancy ultrasound last month, a woman living near the Utah-Idaho border learned she had a major rupture in her amniotic sac. The 27-year-old is a gestational surrogate, which means the fetus she was carrying was for someone else — in this case, a man who lives abroad. The fetus, she was told, was unlikely to survive, and her own health was at risk if she continued the pregnancy."

Utah,2022,Q3,"The director of the nation’s largest network of food banks is seeing support dwindle as need rises: “You’re in the middle of a battle, and people are leaving the field.” The first time Kelly Wilcox drove her 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan to the food pantry near her home in Payson, Utah, she noticed one thing right away that surprised her: newer models of Toyota and Honda sedans and minivans. “I saw a bunch of other people with cars like mine, who had kids in cars,” she said."
Utah,2022,Q3,"Patients given a combination “polypill” after a heart attack were more likely to stick to their regimens, researchers reported. Heart disease kills more people than any other condition, but despite advances in treatment and prevention, patients often do not stick to their medication regimens. Now researchers may have found a solution: a so-called polypill that combines three drugs needed to prevent cardiovascular trouble."
Utah,2022,Q4,"The Senate passed legislation to avert a government shutdown this weekend as negotiators worked to finalize an agreement to provide funding through September. WASHINGTON — Congress cleared a one-week spending bill on Thursday to avert a government shutdown this weekend, buying additional time for lawmakers to resolve frenzied negotiations over a broader spending package to keep agencies and departments funded through next fall."
Utah,2022,Q4,"The report by Senate Democrats points to widespread misbehavior by the plans and the marketing firms they hire. Companies selling private Medicare plans to older adults have posed as the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies, misled customers about the size of their networks and preyed on vulnerable people with dementia and cognitive impairment, according to a new investigation of deceptive marketing practices in the industry released Thursday by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee."

Utah,2022,Q4,"My longstanding concern about our cohesion and commitment has been vindicated. For most of my adult life, I have hesitated when asked whether I identify as a member of the “pro-life” movement, despite my unconditional opposition to abortion. For one thing, I am not conscious of taking part in anything that resembles activism, though my wife volunteers as a birth assistant and doula for women who would otherwise receive very poor care."
Utah,2022,Q4,"The legislation, which would fund the government through September, would significantly increase federal spending and provide billions of dollars in emergency aid.

Utah,2023,Q3,"Parents and public health experts have a lot to say about what adolescent girls do on their phones. We asked teens to weigh in. Psychologists suggest teenagers take social media breaks, and ask themselves as they scroll: “Do I feel bad about myself while looking at this?” Public health experts recommend “adult monitoring” and setting clear boundaries for when and where teens have access to their phones. The surgeon general wants parents to keep their child’s bedroom device-free for at least an hour before bedtime, and through the night. In Utah, lawmakers have determined that kids under 18 should not have access to TikTok or Instagram without parental permission."

Utah,2023,Q4,"The journalist McKay Coppins takes stock of the politician and former presidential candidate’s career as he prepares to retire from elective office. “For most of his life, he has nursed a morbid fascination with his own death, suspecting that it might assert itself one day suddenly and violently.” One doesn’t expect these opening words from an authorized biography of a handsome, wealthy, happily married and instinctively moderate man, but this is how McKay Coppins’s “Romney” begins. Perhaps Mitt Romney fears his severance from so many blessings, but as Coppins’s revealing new book demonstrates, this businessman-politician has often wondered if he deserved such an abundance of good fortune at all."

Utah,2023,Q4,"There are two Americas, and they are divided by a college degree. By many measures, the U.S. economy is thriving: Unemployment stands close to the 50-year low set in April, the fraction of people age 25 to 54 in work is at a two-decade high, gross domestic product is growing rapidly, inflation is falling, and the S&P 500 is a third higher than it was before the Covid pandemic."
Utah,2023,Q4,"You’ll need to adjust for your shortcomings (and take a well-timed nap). Most of us know that good sleep is a pillar of good health, on par with exercise and nutrition. And yet most of us have had a night (or many nights) when it all went sideways."
Utah,2023,Q4,It’s antibiotic season. Brush up on how you should use them — and when to avoid them. Chasing away an infection with the right antibiotic can feel magical.
Utah,2023,Q4,"Their technology is impressive, but imperfect. We asked experts whether they can really help you get a better night’s rest. Shawn McCall, 48, a personal trainer in Waterford, Mich., started tracking his sleep almost six years ago. Mr. McCall said that his Oura Ring — a sleek titanium device that he wears on his ring finger — has revealed how the choices he makes during his waking hours affect his sleep at night."
Utah,2023,Q4,"Federal judges in three states have blocked children’s privacy and parental oversight laws, saying they very likely violate free speech rights. Last fall, California lawmakers passed a sweeping online children’s privacy law aimed at regulating how some of the most popular social media and video game platforms treat minors."
Utah,2023,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage. For 35 years, Angela Jemmott and her five brothers paid premiums on a long-term care insurance policy for their 91-year-old mother. But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."
Utah,2023,Q4,"Legislation would require parental consent for anyone under 18 to access the algorithm-based feeds on TikTok, Instagram and other platforms. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have harnessed powerful algorithms to captivate millions of users with endless streams of entertaining videos and content, transforming the way new generations scroll through their screens."
Utah,2024,Q1,"Complaints have been mounting on social media, and now a group has filed a lawsuit, as the service has continued rolling out policies against accepting cash to enter federal parks. At dozens of national parks and historic sites around the United States, getting away from it all to revel in the country’s wide open spaces has taken on a whole new meaning."
Utah,2024,Q1,"Cases of trisomy 18 may rise as many states restrict abortion. But some women choose to have the babies, love them tenderly and care for them devotedly. Ashlee Wiseman, a waitress at a Sizzler in Idaho Falls, Idaho, was 10 weeks pregnant when a nurse phoned with crushing news: a test of fetal DNA in her blood had found that her baby girl had trisomy 18, a catastrophic genetic abnormality, and was unlikely to survive."
Utah,2024,Q1,"Republican attorneys general from 24 states said the crackdown on fine industrial particles would raise costs. The E.P.A. said it would save lives. Manufacturers and 24 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday over the Biden administration’s decision to tighten limits on fine industrial particles, one of the most common and deadliest forms of air pollution."
Utah,2024,Q1,"With Covid deaths rising to about 1,500 per week, researchers question why Paxlovid use has remained low among high-risk patients. As Covid rises again, killing about 1,500 Americans each week, medical researchers are trying to understand why so few people are taking Paxlovid, a medicine that is stunningly effective in preventing severe illness and death from the disease."
Utah,2024,Q1,"Distracted driving is a worsening problem, safety experts say. Yet there is still no definitive database of the number of crashes or fatalities caused by it. Cellphones can track what we say and write, where we go, what we buy and what we search on the internet. But they still aren’t being used to track one of the biggest public health threats: crashes caused by drivers distracted by the phones."
Utah,2024,Q1,"The festival, seen as a barometer for the overall health of the film industry, featured several movies and documentaries snatched up by studios and streaming services. Talk of the demise of the Sundance Film Festival as an incubator for audience-friendly independent films appears to have been greatly exaggerated."
Utah,2024,Q1,"Also, Trump’s lawyers said he can’t secure a bond for his civil fraud judgment. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. The Supreme Court today heard arguments from Missouri and Louisiana, two Republican-led states that accused the Biden administration of violating the First Amendment by urging social media platforms to remove content that the government considered misinformation. "
Utah,2024,Q1,"Her children’s books on matters of sex and sexuality — notably “It’s Perfectly Normal” — became fodder for the culture wars. Robie Harris, a children’s book author and former teacher whose writing about sexuality made her among the most banned authors in America, died on Jan. 6 in Manhattan. She was 83."
Utah,2024,Q1,"The measure would bar networks like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram from giving accounts to children under 16. Florida’s Legislature has passed a sweeping social media bill that would make the state the first to effectively bar young people under 16 from holding accounts on platforms like TikTok and Instagram."

Utah,2024,Q2,"Across the country, more intense heat, storms and fires are causing the home insurance market to start to buckle. As climate change gets worse, the immediate effects are becoming painfully obvious: More frequent and severe storms, wildfires, hurricanes and other types of extreme weather are wreaking havoc and pushing millions of Americans out of their homes each year."
Utah,2024,Q2,"When a child in a small Cambodian town fell sick recently, his rapid decline set off a global disease surveillance system. As Dr. Sreyleak Luch drove to work the morning of Feb. 8, through busy sunbaked streets in Cambodia’s Mekong river delta, she played the overnight voice messages from her team. The condition of a 9-year-old boy she had been caring for had deteriorated sharply, and he had been intubated, one doctor reported. What, she wondered, could make the child so sick, so fast?"
Utah,2024,Q2,"Tens of millions of farm animals cross state lines every year, traveling in cramped, stressful conditions that can facilitate the spread of disease. The bird flu virus that is spreading through American dairy cows can probably be traced back to a single spillover event. Late last year, scientists believe, the virus jumped from wild birds into cattle in the Texas panhandle. By this spring, the virus, known as H5N1, had traveled hundreds of miles or more, appearing on farms in Idaho, North Carolina and Michigan."

Utah,2024,Q2,"Instead of continuing the environmental legacy they were once known for, Republicans have ceded the fight against climate change to Democrats. Conservatives were once America’s environmental champions. Not that long ago, Republican presidents were carrying out the Clean Air and Water Acts, creating the Environmental Protection Agency, expanding the National Park System and even initiating the country’s most authoritative report on climate change, the National Climate Assessment."
Utah,2024,Q2,"In states that have banned abortion, hospitals have struggled to treat pregnant women facing health risks. A Supreme Court decision this week did not help. Nicole Miller had gone to the emergency room in Boise, Idaho, after waking up with heavy bleeding in her 20th week of pregnancy. By afternoon, she was still leaking amniotic fluid and hemorrhaging and, now in a panic, struggling to understand why the doctor was telling her that she needed to leave the state to be treated."
Utah,2024,Q2,"Elon Musk’s first human experiment with a computerized brain device developed significant flaws, but the subject, who is paralyzed, has few regrets. Just four months ago, Noland Arbaugh had a circle of bone removed from his skull and hair-thin sensor tentacles slipped into his brain. A computer about the size of a small stack of quarters was placed on top and the hole was sealed."
Utah,2024,Q2,"Noelia Voigt’s announcement this week that she was stepping down as Miss USA set off a string of departures and prompted larger questions about the inner workings of the organization. When the reigning Miss USA, Noelia Voigt, announced this week she would be resigning from her position, she cited her mental health and wrote about her gratitude for the opportunity."
Utah,2024,Q3,"There are many reasons to terminate a pregnancy. Here are two abortion stories. Both are mine. Both came with heartache and upheaval — and both prevented heartache and upheaval. One was an experience common to many abortion patients, but one that people often look on with disdain. The other was the sort that generally garners public sympathy. I wish they both did."
Utah,2024,Q3,"Rapamycin is typically prescribed as an immunosuppressive, but off-label users believe it can do much more. In March, Robert Berger, 69, a self-proclaimed “better-living-through-chemistry type of person,” started taking a small dose of rapamycin once a week with the goal of increasing his “health span” — the amount of time he might live without serious disease."
Utah,2024,Q3,We explore why it matters and whether the limit might change. Drunk driving is illegal almost everywhere. But what counts as drunk? Nations answer that question differently. Most say you can’t get behind the wheel when the concentration of alcohol in your blood (commonly known as B.A.C.) is 0.05 percent or more.
Utah,2024,Q3,"Also, Debby is bringing historic levels of rain to the Southeast. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris announced today that she had selected Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate, betting that his Midwestern appeal and plain-spoken attacks on Republicans will help her defeat Donald Trump on Election Day."
Utah,2024,Q3,"The military cemetery said in a statement that federal law prohibits political campaigning on the grounds, and that “there was an incident, and a report was filed.” Members of Donald J. Trump’s campaign team and an official at Arlington National Cemetery confronted each other during the former president’s visit to the cemetery on Monday, the military cemetery said in a statement on Tuesday."
Utah,2024,Q3,"The health care system in Houston, where more than a million customers lack power, was overwhelmed because some patients couldn’t be discharged amid a punishing heat wave. A searing heat wave that has engulfed much of the western United States for over a week will continue to bring dangerously high temperatures through Saturday before sliding east to the central and eastern U.S. by Sunday."

Utah,2024,Q3,"Multiple shows at the Edinburgh Fringe make camp fun out of the 2023 civil action that spurred a thousand memes — and one of them is a triumph. Terry Sanderson, a retired optometrist, was unsuccessful when he sued the actress turned wellness entrepreneur Gwyneth Paltrow over a collision on a Utah ski slope. Though he claimed that she had crashed into him, a jury determined it was actually his fault. The live-streamed 2023 civil case was an unseemly but strangely fascinating spectacle featuring two equally dislikable archetypes: the vexatious litigant and the preening, out-of-touch celebrity."
Utah,2024,Q3,"Republican officials have largely treated President Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race with suspicion and scorn, a Times analysis found, with some calling the development a “coup” or demanding that Mr. Biden resign.

Utah,2024,Q3,"There isn’t much science to it. During the Camp fire in November 2018, I began to wonder exactly how wildfires get their names. That blaze turned into the deadliest in California history, devastating the town of Paradise in Butte County — but the fire’s name conjured images of grinning children around a bonfire."
Utah,2024,Q4,"Also, an attack on Israeli soccer fans. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. Early signs emerged today of how quickly President-elect Donald Trump’s second administration would shift the government’s legal positions on a wide range of issues facing the Supreme Court, as speculation swirled about whom Trump would tap for critical positions in the government."
Utah,2024,Q4,"NetChoice, backed by tech giants including Meta and Google, has successfully argued in court that Big Tech hosts protected speech.

Utah,2024,Q4,"Opinions abound on how to customize the popular soda. Purists, meanwhile, will see you at McDonald’s. The latest battle in the soda wars isn’t Coke versus Pepsi. It’s Diet Coke versus Diet Coke, and the fandom is bubbling over on social media."
Utah,2024,Q4,"After reports that the team includes a transgender player, several schools have forfeited matches against the university out of protest. The San Jose State University women’s volleyball team is trying to make the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time in 23 years. But first, it must find schools willing to play against it."
Utah,2024,Q4,"President-elect Donald J. Trump’s transition team for climate and the environment is considering relocating the E.P.A. out of Washington and other drastic changes. As President-elect Donald J. Trump’s transition team plans his energy and environment agenda, it is relying on two seasoned former cabinet leaders and fossil fuel lobbyists to dramatically reshape the agencies charged with protecting the nation’s air, water, climate and public lands, according to six people familiar with the matter."
Utah,2024,Q4,A study of Gila monster venom helped start the revolution in weight-loss drugs. But scientists think that’s just the beginning. There are two opposite paths to achievement in science. The first is straightforward: Identify a problem and set about solving it. The second is rather unscientific-sounding and perhaps more faith-based: Study in obscurity and hope serendipity strikes.
Utah,2024,Q4,"Also, the U.S. said North Korea sent troops to aid Russia. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. Kamala Harris delivered a short and searing statement today from the vice president’s official residence at the Naval Observatory, rarely a site for political events. She called Donald Trump “unhinged and unstable,” and said that reports that he made admiring remarks about Hitler offered voters “a window into who Donald Trump really is.”"
Utah,2024,Q4,"Mr. Trump and his allies envision a second term that would try to permanently eliminate protections for air, water and climate. On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants “the cleanest air and the cleanest water.”"
Utah,2024,Q4,"We spoke with Americans who are packing up and moving out. Good evening! Lots of people muse about leaving the country if an election doesn’t go their way. My colleague, Ronda Kaysen, who covers real estate, spoke with Americans who say they’re actually planning to. Plus, we look at what it’s like to listen to a whole speech by former President Trump. — Jess Bidgood"
Utah,2024,Q4,"The president-elect held his first formal transition meetings and has been given lists of candidates, but is calling around to friends and allies for ideas. President-elect Donald J.

Vermont,2020,Q1,"“Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,” Mr. Biden said. In his own address, Mr. Sanders said the coronavirus crisis was “on the scale of major war.” WILMINGTON, Del. — Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday delivered a forceful rebuke of President Trump’s leadership amid the coronavirus crisis, seeking to project steadiness and resolve from his perch as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Vermont,2020,Q1,"With the coronavirus as a backdrop, and with no audience in attendance, the two Democrats were at times feisty discussing their differences over health care. Mr. Biden also committed to choosing a woman as a running mate. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders called for vastly more aggressive government action to battle the coronavirus but split over some of the details along familiar ideological lines on Sunday night, as the two Democrats tangled over the right to lead their party into a campaign overshadowed by the pandemic inflicting havoc on the country’s economy and its social fabric."
Vermont,2020,Q1,"The Vermont senator has made exaggerated claims or statements that lacked context about “Medicare for all,” his antiwar record and his history of bipartisanship. Before the first votes are cast in the Democratic presidential contest, The New York Times reviewed statements Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has made promoting his signature “Medicare for all” proposal, highlighting his long-held opposition to military intervention and arguing that he can work across the aisle. Here’s a fact-check."

Vermont,2020,Q2,"The move would have made it easier for people who have recently lost jobs to obtain health insurance.

Vermont,2020,Q2,"The pandemic has closed many mental-health residential centers, sending residents home to families ill equipped for the challenges. The panic spirals up from somewhere in Connor Langan’s midsection, and so quickly that his face changes; wild in the eyes, his upper lip trembling, he sometimes punches a wall in frustration. Such episodes resulted in Connor, 17, being placed on leave from high school late last year, and in early March he agreed to enroll at Mountain Valley, a New Hampshire residential program well known for addressing anxiety problems in young people."
Vermont,2020,Q2,"The unequal impact of the pandemic and economic collapse are forcing us to rethink the assumptions of our system. We are the richest country in the history of the world, but at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, that reality means little to half of our people who live paycheck to paycheck, the 40 million living in poverty, the 87 million who are uninsured or underinsured, and the half million who are homeless."
Vermont,2020,Q2,"Dentists are donning head-to-toe protective equipment, switching to laser instruments and taking other steps to reassure patients that it’s safe to get back in the chair.

Vermont,2020,Q2,"Despite executive orders for social distancing, Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms continue to offer homes and “quarantine apartments” as retreats. As communities tighten rules on social distancing, the short-term rental has become a fraught piece of turf. In areas like the Jersey Shore and Newport Beach, Calif., and in states like Pennsylvania and Vermont, officials have severely restricted short-term rentals to discourage residents of urban hot zones from spreading the coronavirus to lower-density locations. Recent evidence has shown that their caution is justified."

New York City gutted a nascent composting program that could have kept tons of food waste out of landfills. New Jersey postponed property-tax relief payments.
Vermont,2020,Q3,"A national campaign to encourage mask wearing, including the distribution of free masks, would help to check the pandemic. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont introduced legislation this week that directs the Trump administration to send three “high-quality, reusable” masks to every person in the United States, and would provide $5 billion to increase mask production. This is a good idea."

Vermont,2021,Q1,"A strong sense of self-efficacy is one of the most powerful protective factors parents can give their children. In the decade that I was an active alcoholic, my focus was on protecting my right to drink the way I wanted to drink, and keeping my drinking a secret from my family.

Vermont,2023,Q2,"New York City’s pioneering, focused approach sets rules on how companies use the technology in work force decisions. European lawmakers are finishing work on an A.I. act. The Biden administration and leaders in Congress have their plans for reining in artificial intelligence. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, maker of the A.I. sensation ChatGPT, recommended the creation of a federal agency with oversight and licensing authority in Senate testimony last week. And the topic came up at the Group of 7 summit in Japan."
Vermont,2023,Q2,"New York does not require bystanders to act when someone is in danger, but the killing on the F train has residents debating when they should step in. As Jordan Neely struggled to free himself from a chokehold in the New York City subway earlier this month, there were the passengers who pinned him down and the passengers who watched."
Vermont,2023,Q2,"What’s new about the latest version of these Senate holds is the breadth and long-term nature of their effects. Instead of showing up for work last Tuesday, Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, went to Donald Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., to hear the former president rail against his latest criminal indictment. Mr. Tuberville’s absence from the Capitol gave the Senate an opportunity to end his one-man blockade of all military promotions, a campaign he has been waging for four months to protest the Pentagon’s policy paying for service members to travel for an abortion if they live in a state where it is illegal."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water. The drought-stricken Mississippi River can no longer hold back the saltwater creeping upstream, contaminating drinking water."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii sees lessons far beyond the islands in the disaster that has unfolded on Maui. In early 2020, with state health officials downplaying signs of the coming pandemic, Josh Green, who was then Hawaii’s lieutenant governor, went outside the political pecking order and called the White House himself to ask for a temporary ban on cruise ships, a linchpin of Hawaii’s economy."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"To participate, submit your response here by July 21 at 9 a.m. Eastern. This week’s winners will be announced on Aug. 1. Update, Aug. 2: Winners for this week have been announced."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"The exhibition “Barvalo” is billed as the first show of its kind to combine contributions from multiple Romani artists and curators. They are sharing their culture on their own terms. When Gabi Jimenez, a French Spanish Romani painter, first heard several years ago that a major museum in France was planning an exhibition on Romani culture and history, he said he thought it would be “a mess.”"
Vermont,2023,Q3,"Plus, the U.S. reached a deal with Iran to free Americans. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. President Biden issued a major disaster declaration for Maui as evacuation centers filled and tourists fled from the island in the wake of a fast-moving wildfire. The death toll climbed to 36, and hundreds of buildings were damaged in the tourist town of Lahaina and elsewhere on the western coast."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"Hoping to break through a crowded presidential field in 2024, the former Texas congressman is pitching himself as a modern and moderate Republican with a bipartisan vision. It is the stuff of viral internet legend now. After snow disrupted their flights, Will Hurd, the former Republican congressman, and Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat from a neighboring district, climbed into a rented Chevy Impala and took a cross-country road trip from their home state of Texas to Washington."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated. In the wake of the decision, 15 largely conservative states imposed near-total bans (through trigger laws or new legislation), and two more set limits at six weeks of pregnancy. "
Vermont,2023,Q3,"The United Auto Workers union is threatening to expand strikes on Friday if it does not make significant progress in talks with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Negotiations between each of the three large U.S. automakers and the United Auto Workers union remain far from being resolved, but one of the companies — Ford Motor — has averted a second strike in Canada."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"Also, Turkey clears the way for Sweden to join NATO. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. Torrential rainfall caused widespread flooding today in the river valleys and mountain towns of New York State and western New England. One woman died, and dozens more were rescued from rising waters. The Northeast is forecast to receive several more days of rain, especially in Vermont, where officials warned of “life-threatening flash flooding” throughout the day. Follow our live updates."
Vermont,2023,Q3,"The BBC is no ordinary media outlet and its presenter is no ordinary journalist. But the network’s wall-to-wall coverage has raised questions of its own. There were urgent NATO meetings about the war in Ukraine, raging floods from India to Vermont, and a record heat wave across America. But this week the BBC wound up airing wall-to-wall coverage of a different story: itself."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"“Woman,” which she hosted, brought frank talk about issues like birth control, pay inequality and homosexuality into millions of homes in the 1970s. Sandra Elkin, who as the creator and host of the weekly PBS talk show “Woman” in the mid-1970s brought frank discussions about birth control, job discrimination, health care and other issues confronting American women into millions of living rooms across the country, died on Nov. 8 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85."
Vermont,2023,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Vermont,2023,Q4,"Adult children discuss the trials of caring for their aging parents: unreliable agencies, a lack of help and dwindling financial resources. I am 39 years old. I had to care for my father, who passed from cancer in 2019; my mother, who passed in November 2021 from cancer; and since her passing I have inherited the care of my grandmother. She is 97, diagnosed with moderate dementia and is considered high risk to be left home alone. We had been applying for Medicaid long-term care to receive a home health aide since early November 2021. She finally got a home health aide in January 2022, but it’s been a nightmare. They are so desperate to hire workers that they will take anyone. She was left without an aide on many random days with a late-notice telephone call or text message from the aide needing the day off and the agencies not able to find a replacement in time. I have changed agencies multiple times. My husband has been a great support the entire time. We rely on security cameras we installed in our apartment to see how she is doing while we are at work. How is it on a daily basis? It is emotionally and physically draining. The health care system for the elderly is neglected, broken and inadequate to meet any demands, even the basic needs."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"The progressive disappointment with the Vermont senator, a liberal icon, reflects a broader divide among Democrats over the war. On a Democratic primary debate stage in Brooklyn in 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders caused a ruckus within his party when he rebuked Hillary Clinton for not mentioning Palestinian rights in a speech she made to a pro-Israel lobbying group."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"Some older adults are skipping a sun-drenched post-work life and moving instead to the next step: choosing to live near children and grandchildren. After touring several retirement communities, Marta Genoni winnowed the field to two appealing possibilities not far from the home she shared with her husband, Kenneth, a lawyer, in Westfield, N.J. But unable to make a final decision she asked her elder daughter, a college administrator in Richmond, Va., to come north and weigh in."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"There are ways to reduce the stress and expense of ending a marriage, but they require both parties to want to end the relationship civilly. If there is an easy point of agreement in the emotional upheaval of divorce, it is that endless legal battles can break the bank."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"If you notice drastic shifts in your mood during certain times of the year, you could have seasonal affective disorder. Here are answers to your top questions about the condition. The fall and winter months often signal the season of celebration and holidays. But for many, the darker, colder days herald another type of period: one of fatigue, lethargy and depression."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"A third day of hostage exchanges in Israel. Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, released 17 more hostages, including a 4-year-old girl, and said it would seek to extend a temporary cease-fire with Israel. The current four-day pause is scheduled to end today. An additional 39 Palestinians in custody were freed on Sunday, according to Israel’s prison service."
Vermont,2023,Q4,"Plus Indonesia’s female forest rangers. Israel and Hamas agreed yesterday to extend their fragile truce for two more days, according to officials in Qatar who helped negotiate the initial cease-fire. "
Vermont,2023,Q4,"We have the tools we need to create a world where addiction is just one aspect of people’s lives instead of a dark portal to despair and early death. Raina Mcmahan, a 42-year-old recovery coach, spent roughly half her life seeking treatment for her own opioid use disorder."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"Officials warned of slippery commutes, with snow likely from the Midwest to the Northeast on Friday. Frigid temperatures will surge east through Saturday, but warmer weather is on the way. Another blast of Arctic air was roaring across the Midwest on Friday on its way to the eastern United States, where snow was already falling in New York and other areas, some schools were canceled and officials warned of dangerous driving conditions."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"A new report based on records from the Trump and Biden years found the average length of solitary detainment was longer than the duration the U.N. says can constitute torture. The United States government has placed detained immigrants in solitary confinement more than 14,000 times in the last five years, and the average duration is almost twice the 15-day threshold that the United Nations has said may constitute torture, according to a new analysis of federal records by researchers at Harvard and the nonprofit group Physicians for Human Rights."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"Some people are especially sensitive to the weather, but it can be difficult to pinpoint why. Q: I tend to feel more tired than usual when it’s cloudy or rainy. Why is that?"
Vermont,2024,Q1,"The consumer goods giant said the moves would make for a “simpler, more focused company” as consumers trade down to cheaper brands amid high inflation. Unilever, the consumer goods giant, said on Tuesday that it would cut 7,500 jobs and spin off its ice cream unit, which includes Ben & Jerry’s, to reduce costs and simplify its portfolio of brands."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"Shiffrin, the champion American ski racer, is an unabashed Swiftie, and has long seen the pop culture force as a textbook guide for navigating fame, adversity and unprecedented success. As Mikaela Shiffrin plans the next phase of her record-setting career as a skier, she is looking, as she always has, to the example of another female megastar who has experienced kindred highs and lows and highs in her career: Taylor Swift."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"Health officials say 57 people have been hospitalized in a listeria outbreak linked to Boar’s Head deli meats. The bacteria Listeria monocytogenes can turn up in all types of food: salad dressings, soft cheeses, cold-cut meats, fresh vegetables and more."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"The first nationwide count of telehealth abortions includes pills mailed to states with abortion bans by clinicians in states with shield laws. A growing share of abortions is now being administered through telemedicine, with clinicians prescribing mail-order abortion pills after online consultations, according to the first nationwide count of telehealth abortions in the U.S. medical system. At least one in six abortions, around 14,000 a month, was conducted via telehealth from July through September, the most recent months with available data."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"A small share of motorists burns about a third of America’s gasoline, a study found. Switching to electric vehicles would make a huge dent in climate-warming emissions. The key to cutting emissions from cars and light trucks that are heating the planet could lie with the nation’s super drivers, the small percentage of American motorists who drive, on average, about 110 miles per day."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"Off the field, he earned a Ph.D. in mathematics and taught the subject at Rice and Yale. And he brought computers to the House of Representatives. In his 13-year N.F.L. career, Frank Ryan passed for 149 touchdowns, went to the Pro Bowl three times and took the Cleveland Browns to the 1964 N.F.L. championship, throwing three second-half touchdowns in that victory."
Vermont,2024,Q1,"Also, Putin threatened nuclear war over NATO intervention. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. President Biden and Donald Trump both traveled to southern Texas today to use the border with Mexico as a backdrop for their push to convince voters that they would best handle the recent surge in migrants crossing into the U.S. "
Vermont,2024,Q2,"The city was once hailed for its response to addiction. But as fentanyl flooded the streets and officials shifted priorities, deaths hit unprecedented heights. People in Baltimore have been dying of overdoses at a rate never before seen in a major American city."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"The excessive heat was being felt in the Midwest on Monday as the heat index, a measure of how the temperature feels with humidity, hit 102 degrees in Cincinnati. Follow our updates for the latest on the heat wave across the U.S."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"In a letter, a dozen groups and labor unions called on the president to enforce a law that bars military support from going to any nation that restricts the delivery of humanitarian aid. A coalition of a dozen liberal organizations and labor unions sent a letter to the White House on Thursday night demanding that President Biden end military aid to Israel until its government lifts restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza, the latest indicator of shifting mainstream Democratic opinion on the war."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"The police department charged with protecting lawmakers has brought in new attorneys specially responsible for prosecuting people who make violent threats against members of Congress. The Capitol Police, facing a flood of violent threats against members of Congress that is expected to rise with the upcoming November elections, have begun hiring prosecutors dedicated to going after people who threaten lawmakers."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"Organizations that describe themselves as churches are providing psychedelics to followers. The compounds, which show promise as treatments for depression, are illegal in most settings. Facing the latest participants attending her four-day psychedelic retreat, Whitney Lasseter made a bold claim: The ceremonies they would take part in were sanctioned by federal law, which sets a high bar for the government to interfere in religious practices."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"Novo Nordisk’s factories work nonstop turning out Ozempic and Wegovy, its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, but the Danish company has far bigger ambitions. Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen has a problem: Too many people want what he’s selling."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"Infected with ideological purity, the West Coast is focused more on intentions than on oversight and outcomes. As Democrats make their case to voters around the country this fall, one challenge is that some of the bluest parts of the country — cities on the West Coast — are a mess."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders rallied with Jamaal Bowman on Saturday, three days before the primary on Tuesday. He cracked jokes on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” spit verses with the rapper Cash Cobain and spent the weekend rallying with two of the left’s biggest names: Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"We explain a decline in overdose deaths. Last week brought some rare good news on drugs: Overdose deaths declined in 2023. And while the opioid crisis has taken some surprising and terrible twists over the years, it may finally be turning around."
Vermont,2024,Q2,"Policy alone won’t get women what they deserve. American women made significant progress toward closing the gender pay gap in the second half of the 20th century, but that gap has barely budged over the past two decades. In 2022, according to Pew Research, “American women typically earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. That was about the same as in 2002, when they earned 80 cents to the dollar.”"
Vermont,2024,Q3,"Congress should pass a spending bill to make a permanent pay increase a reality. Earlier this month, the United States was on the verge of a nightmare scenario. Several Western wildfires were raging at once. In California, San Bernardino County was in a state of emergency; the nearby Bridge fire had destroyed 54 structures, stretching the state’s resources thin. Smoldering fires were reigniting across Washington and Oregon, and the Davis fire bore down on ski resorts near Reno, Nev., burning 14 structures. There wasn’t a single elite operations unit available — the kind you call in to manage major wildfires."
Vermont,2024,Q3,"The decrease across the country is a major breakthrough in efforts to reverse the effects of fentanyl. Researchers and health officials say there is no easy explanation for the trend. Drug overdose deaths are decreasing sharply across the country, according to recent state and federal data, a dramatic improvement in the nation’s efforts to reverse the consequences of fentanyl’s spread in the illicit drug supply."
Vermont,2024,Q3,"Some worry that this active ingredient is toxic. Here’s what we know about its effect on human health. Q: Everyone says that the DEET in bug spray is awful, but my own research seems to suggest that it’s well-tested and safe. Am I giving myself a little bit of cancer every time I use it?"
Vermont,2024,Q3,Recent infections from the Eastern equine encephalitis virus are worrying health officials. Severe cases can be deadly or leave lasting injuries. Residents of 10 communities in Massachusetts have been warned to stay indoors from dusk to dawn. Some local parks are closed at night. A person in New Hampshire has died. Pesticides are being sprayed from trucks and aircrafts.
Vermont,2024,Q3,Ten states could expand abortion rights via ballot measures. Nebraska will also vote on proposed restrictions. Ten states could expand abortion rights via ballot measures. Nebraska will also vote on proposed restrictions.
Vermont,2024,Q3,Enough! It’s time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking. Update: This guest essay was published before the assassination attempt on former President Trump and has been updated by the author to reflect the shooting.
Vermont,2024,Q3,"The vice president should triple down on the issue to clinch this race. Among the many critical issues at stake in the 2024 election, one will be central for many Americans: Whom do you trust to make medical decisions — women and their doctors, or Donald Trump and JD Vance?"
Vermont,2024,Q3,"We cover the history of White House health cover-ups. The scandal is almost as old as the United States itself: The president has a health problem that he and his aides try to shroud from the public. Only later — years later, in some cases — does the severity become clear."
Vermont,2024,Q3,"delegates from Uncommitted, a movement calling for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel, are demanding that a speaker of Palestinian descent address the convention from the main stage, as relatives of a hostage being held in Gaza spoke on Wednesday evening. Behind the scenes at the Democratic National Convention, delegates from Uncommitted, a movement calling for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel, demanded that a speaker of Palestinian descent address the convention from the main stage, as relatives of a hostage being held in Gaza spoke on Wednesday evening."
Vermont,2024,Q3,"Collectors tend to buy the vehicles they loved in their youth, but millennials and Gen-Zers are skipping back generations. Acting on a tip from an acquaintance, Cameron Luther uncovered a butterscotch yellow 1966 Porsche in a garage in Monterey, Calif. It was dusty and up on jack stands with the wheels off. It clearly hadn’t run in a long time."
Vermont,2024,Q4,"As colleagues, Ariana Silvestro and Nicholas Kluender developed feelings for each other in 2016, but waited to pursue them. Ariana Silvestro, a founder and chief executive of the fragrance company Scent Lab, spoke from the heart in 2018 when she told Nicholas Austin Kluender she thought they should revisit feelings they started exploring two years earlier."
Vermont,2024,Q4,"“There was no appreciation — no appreciation — of the struggling and the suffering of millions and millions of working-class people,” the senator said. As the Democratic Party grapples with its sweeping electoral loss and a new political reality, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been resolute about his diagnosis of where the party went wrong."
Vermont,2024,Q4,"JD Vance and others on the “new right” say limiting immigration will raise wages and give jobs to sidelined Americans. Many studies suggest otherwise. As President-elect Donald J. Trump’s second administration takes shape, his plans for a signature campaign promise are becoming clear: mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, including new detention centers, workplace raids and possibly the mobilization of the military to aid in expulsions."
Vermont,2024,Q4,"The New York congresswoman’s foray onto the presidential campaign trail may be a turning point for her and her party. She leaped into office six years ago as a 29-year-old outsider intent on upending the Democratic establishment, and has used her platform to challenge party leaders at nearly every turn."
Vermont,2024,Q4,"The hyper-macho and online energy of the Trump campaign is now aimed at Washington. It used to be that the perfect cabinet pick was a steady, behind-the-scenes expert who wouldn’t take too much attention away from the president."
Vermont,2024,Q4,Ballot measures that passed on Tuesday will lift abortion bans in two states and expand access in others. Defeated measures in three states mean their abortion restrictions will remain in place. Ballot measures that passed on Tuesday will lift abortion bans in two states and expand access in others. Defeated measures in three states mean their abortion restrictions will remain in place.
Vermont,2024,Q4,"Canada expelled six Indian diplomats after the police said they had evidence that India used intimidation and even murder to silence its critics in Canada. Thanksgiving has never been the outsize family gathering time in Canada that it is in the United States. (In Atlantic Canada, it’s not even a holiday.) But this year, it was marked in an unusual way."
Vermont,2024,Q4,"Representative David Schweikert, a vulnerable Republican, is fighting for his political life in suburban Arizona, where the sprint to win over a crucial bloc of voters is coming down to the wire. Knocking on doors in Phoenix and Scottsdale in the election’s frantic final days, canvassers working on behalf of the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House were greeted by reactions from across the political spectrum."
Vermont,2024,Q4,"The vice president will take questions from Bret Baier in a session to be broadcast at 6 p.m. She joins a long line of Democratic candidates and elected officials who have ventured into hostile television territory. Vice President Kamala Harris’s interview with Fox News’s chief political anchor, Bret Baier, at 6 p.m. Eastern is, by any measure, a risk for her and a test of her ability to handle a potentially contentious interview in an unfriendly setting. This is the first time that Ms. Harris has sat for an interview on Fox, and it follows a series of interviews that the Democratic presidential candidate has given, including one to “60 Minutes.”"
Vermont,2024,Q4,"NetChoice, backed by tech giants including Meta and Google, has successfully argued in court that Big Tech hosts protected speech. Ahead of a recent vote in Congress on a child safety bill, a powerful tech lobby representing Google, Meta and other major tech firms sent a forceful warning to lawmakers."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"The Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants could make the epidemic worse. In late January, as the new coronavirus was making its first incursion into the United States, the Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration’s contested “public charge” rule, which enables federal officials to deny green cards to immigrants who use social safety net programs. The decision received scant media attention, in part because it was overshadowed by the emerging epidemic. But public health experts warn that the two stories are intimately, perhaps disastrously, related: Infectious disease outbreaks have a long history of preying on society’s most vulnerable, disenfranchised members. Noncitizens who don’t have access to health insurance, nutritious food or safe, affordable housing fall squarely into that category."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"In West Virginia, tougher work requirements for receiving food stamps complicated life for poor people, but did not result in increased employment. MILTON, W.Va. — In the early mornings, Chastity and Paul Peyton walk from their small and barely heated apartment to Taco Bell to clean fryers and take orders for as many work hours as they can get. It rarely adds up to a full-time week’s worth, often not even close. With this income and whatever cash Mr. Peyton can scrape up doing odd jobs — which are hard to come by in a small town in winter, for someone without a car — the couple pays rent, utilities and his child support payments."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"The president is questioning whether stay-at-home orders have gone too far. But relaxing them could significantly increase the death toll from the coronavirus, health officials warn. WASHINGTON — As the United States entered Week 2 of trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus by shuttering large swaths of the economy, President Trump, Wall Street executives and many conservative economists began questioning whether the government had gone too far and should instead lift restrictions that are already inflicting deep pain on workers and businesses."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"As the coronavirus spreads, the public interest requires employers to abandon their longstanding resistance to paid sick leave. Most American restaurants do not offer paid sick leave. Workers who fall sick face a simple choice: Work and get paid or stay home and get stiffed. Not surprisingly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2014 that fully 20 percent of food service workers had come to work at least once in the previous year “while sick with vomiting or diarrhea.”"
Virginia,2020,Q1,"Pediatricians say the automated Baby Brezza dispenser may produce watery bottles of formula. Like many first-time parents, Jon Borgese, a tech executive in Manhattan, had heard the buzz around the Baby Brezza formula maker, a countertop device that automatically dispenses warm bottles of formula at the touch of a button."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"The employee worked in recent days at “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “Six,” prompting a scramble to inform the public and clean the theaters. A part-time usher who recently worked at two Broadway theaters has tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, prompting a scramble to inform the public and clean the buildings, according to the theater owners."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"When concerns about a pipeline were dismissed by regulators, a rural black enclave went to court — and won. In the years following the Civil War, freedmen and freedwomen founded a community close to the Virginia plantations where they had been enslaved. The settlers of Union Hill in Buckingham County, Va., passed down this land over generations to today’s descendants, who are now at the center of a fight to stop a proposed multibillion dollar energy project."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"The decision by the school’s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., to partly reopen his evangelical university enraged residents of Lynchburg, Va. Then a student tested positive for Covid-19. Editors’ Note, July 28, 2021: Earlier versions of this article and its web summary referred imprecisely to the university medical staff’s concerns about Covid-19 on campus. While several students reported to the campus health center with respiratory illnesses, the staff did not conclude that their symptoms indicated that there was a Covid-19 outbreak on campus. One student tested positive."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"Virginia’s shift to the Democrats has been led by suburban moderates, especially college-educated women. Some wonder whether Mr. Sanders is what they signed up for. VIRGINIA BEACH — In the Trump era, the suburbs have been Democrats’ surprising superpower."
Virginia,2020,Q1,"Several of the nation’s top health officials are among those sitting on an advisory panel formed by President Trump. President Trump formed a coronavirus task force in late January, and members have been meeting regularly. But as the virus began to spread around the globe and infections were confirmed in the United States, Mr. Trump named Vice President Mike Pence as his point person at the end of February, and more administration officials were added to the panel. Among them are internationally known AIDS experts; a former drug executive; infectious disease doctors; and the former attorney general of Virginia."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"As the coronavirus hits the White House, Congress and D.C.’s poorest areas, many across the region are asking the Trump administration to proceed with caution. WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration pushes for the federal government to lead the nation in reopening the doors to daily business, the leaders of the capital region that would live with the consequences are fragmented on how to move forward."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"Like many areas around the country, Washington and its suburbs are embracing positive momentum in data on infections to push ahead. WASHINGTON — The leaders around the nation’s capital are pushing forward with plans to reopen the region, hoping they are close enough to their public health goals to move toward normalcy despite coronavirus infection rates that have alarmed federal officials."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"The Centers for Disease Control has been lumping together tests for active coronavirus with tests for recovered patients, boosting testing totals but muddying the pandemic’s course. WASHINGTON — As it tracks the coronavirus’s spread, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is combining tests that detect active infection with those that detect recovery from Covid-19 — a system that muddies the picture of the pandemic but raises the percentage of Americans tested as President Trump boasts about testing."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"The death of Gerald O. Glenn, the bishop of the New Deliverance Evangelistic Church in Chesterfield, Va., was announced during Easter services. A Virginia pastor who defied warnings about the danger of religious gatherings during the pandemic and vowed to keep preaching “unless I’m in jail or the hospital” died over the weekend after contracting Covid-19, his church said."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"Most of us had never heard of aerosol science before the pandemic. Then Virginia Tech’s Linsey Marr showed up and became our tour guide to the invisible world of airborne particles. When Linsey Marr’s son started attending day care 12 years ago, she noticed that he kept getting sick with the sniffles and other minor illnesses. But unlike most parents, Dr. Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech, tried to figure out why."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"Since most people in the U.S. get health insurance through work, many with pre-existing conditions fear unemployment more than they fear coronavirus. Last month, Patti Hanks faced a wrenching decision: go back to her job, or lose her health insurance."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"While the Trump administration’s recommendation ultimately leaves states’ fates to governors, most reopening states fail to meet the criteria for a downward trend in reported coronavirus cases. While the Trump administration’s recommendation ultimately leaves states’ fates to governors, most reopening states fail to meet the criteria for a downward trend in reported coronavirus cases."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"In large swaths of the U.S., people have a hard time reaching a hospital that offers the kind of inpatient care needed to treat the coronavirus. In large swaths of the U.S., people have a hard time reaching a hospital that offers the kind of inpatient care needed to treat the coronavirus."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"Maggie Moore and Brandon Baez married at Glencliff Manor, which offered to help couples whose weddings were upended because of the coronavirus. Maggie Moore and Brandon Baez may be young, but waiting to get married until the world got a handle on the coronavirus was not in their plans."
Virginia,2020,Q2,"Garrison Kenneth Courtney pretended to be a C.I.A. officer to bilk companies. A former Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges of defrauding companies of more than $4 million by pretending to be a Central Intelligence Agency officer involved in an intelligence gathering operation, prosecutors said."
Virginia,2020,Q3,"A popular spring break and summertime destination on the South Carolina coast is linked to clusters of coronavirus cases among teenagers and young adults in several states. MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. — The colorful boardwalk is crowded again, the Ferris wheel spins near one of the piers, tourists are browsing in the souvenir shops, and throngs of young people are cutting loose as they always do, guzzling and carousing in the beachside bars and clubs that earned the city the nickname “Dirty Myrtle.”"

More than a century later, modern life has only gotten faster, and from Bozeman, Mont., to Denver, the West remains a popular place to retreat from it all. But the West Cure was never meant for the people who actually live there."

Washington,2022,Q2,"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci will not attend the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner, but President Biden has concluded it is worth the risk. WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris’s coronavirus infection is raising questions that some in the nation’s capital wish would remain unspoken: Is it safe for President Biden to attend the so-called nerd prom, otherwise known as the White House Correspondents’ Dinner? Should the dinner even be held?"
Washington,2022,Q2,"A police officer shot and killed Andrea Thomas Churna, 39, in her apartment building in Redmond, Wash., after she called 911 for help in September 2020, her lawyer said.

Washington,2022,Q2,"The Democrat is facing off for a second time against Brian Kemp, a Republican — but in a far-more-difficult political climate. ATLANTA — When Teaniese Davis heard that Stacey Abrams was holding a public event on Tuesday morning, she raced to a church parking lot teeming with two dozen cameras and members of the news media, hoping to catch a glimpse of one of Georgia’s most famous Democrats."
Washington,2022,Q3,"There is no technological miracle that will fix decades of bad policy. What if you could get health care as quickly and easily as you order socks and cat litter? It sounds fanciful in a country where people die waiting to see a doctor, but Amazon believed it could do for health care what it had done for shopping. Hailed as “the future of medicine,” the Amazon Care telehealth and house-call service was pitched to employers as “high-quality care, convenience and peace of mind.”"
Washington,2022,Q3,"The designation will free up emergency funds and lift some bureaucratic hurdles, but many experts fear containment may no longer be possible. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Thursday declared the growing monkeypox outbreak a national health emergency, a rare designation signaling that the virus now represents a significant risk to Americans and setting in motion new measures aimed at containing the threat."
Washington,2022,Q3,"Marie Perez, a Democrat, and Joe Kent, a Trump-backed Republican, will face off in November after winning their “jungle primary” against Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler, who criticized Trump after Jan. 6. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, a Republican who voted to impeach former President Donald J. Trump and sharply criticized his actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, conceded her primary Tuesday in a crowded race that included a Trump-backed challenger and other 2020 election deniers."
Washington,2022,Q3,"Starting in 2025, Medicare recipients with prescription drug coverage will not have to pay more than $2,000 annually for medications, a significant savings for some. WASHINGTON — After Pete Spring was diagnosed with dementia in 2016, he and his wife emptied their checking account in part to pay for his prescription drugs, then ran through $60,000 in pension payments before resorting to a charge card to help make sure Mr. Spring had the heart and Alzheimer’s medications he needed to survive — just two of the 11 drugs he took."
Washington,2022,Q3,"A host of new restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues in the nation’s capital are just now spreading their wings. Visitors are back in Washington, for all the reasons they came before."
Washington,2022,Q3,"The famous monument in Greenwich Village is stately. It’s also grimy. Good morning. It’s Friday. We’ll look at how Mayor Eric Adams’s focus on crime may have muddied his efforts to move past the pandemic and get the city going again. But first, what’s been growing on the Washington Arch?"
Washington,2022,Q3,"The National Health Service is closing England’s sole youth gender clinic, which had been criticized for long wait times and inadequate services. The National Health Service in England announced on Thursday that it was shutting down the country’s only youth gender clinic in favor of a more distributed and comprehensive network of medical care for adolescents seeking hormones and other gender treatments."
Washington,2022,Q3,"The move effectively creates a new federal agency — on par with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. The Biden administration is creating a new division within the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate the nation’s response to pandemic threats and other health emergencies, a recognition that the department is structurally ill equipped to handle disasters like the coronavirus pandemic."
Washington,2022,Q3,"In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, abortion benefits will depend even more on where a woman lives and who provides her insurance. Even before the constitutional right to an abortion was struck down last month, health insurance coverage for it was spotty. Abortion benefits largely depended on where a woman lived or whom she worked for."
Washington,2022,Q3,"The $3.9 billion deal is Amazon’s latest acquisition in the health care industry. In 2018, it acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy. SEATTLE — Just two months ago, Andy Jassy, almost a year into his reign as Amazon’s chief executive, told investors that driving down costs was a “really big area of focus,” after the company produced its worst quarterly earnings in years. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t open to a deal."
Washington,2022,Q4,"By reinventing his Senate campaign after a stroke, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman ended up connecting with voters who responded to his saga of loss and comeback.

Washington,2022,Q4,"G.O.P. threats to leverage the full faith and credit of the United States to force spending cuts have raised alarm about a debt showdown next year — and talks about how to head one off in the coming weeks. President Biden and Congress are facing a looming showdown with Republicans over raising the nation’s borrowing limit, alarming administration officials, Democrats in Congress and some investors who fear a stalemate that could roil financial markets at a precarious time for the global economy."
Washington,2022,Q4,"At issue is Title 42, a public health measure invoked by the Trump administration during the pandemic to block migrants from seeking asylum in the United States. WASHINGTON — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued an order on Monday temporarily maintaining a Trump-era public health emergency measure that allows the government to expel migrants seeking asylum who cross the southern border unlawfully."
Washington,2022,Q4,"With few new cases, the plan not to renew the emergency past Jan. 31 is an acknowledgment that the disease previously known as monkeypox has mostly been suppressed. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration said on Friday that it did not expect to extend its declaration of a public health emergency for the outbreak of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, past its scheduled expiration at the end of January, a signal that the disease no longer constitutes a crisis-level threat in the United States."
Washington,2022,Q4,"To protect your sexual function, it’s vital to discuss your sex life, even if that feels awkward. Any medical procedure on the outer genitals carries some risk to sexual function. But so can other pelvic surgeries, including hysterectomies and surgeries to remove ovarian cysts or endometriosis tissue, in part because the clitoris is so interconnected with the nerve supply in that region."
Washington,2022,Q4,About 130 migrants from Texas were bused to the vice president’s home on one of the coldest Christmas Eves on record in the nation’s capital. Dec. 26: This article was updated with a statement from the office of Governor Greg Abbott of Texas.

Washington,2022,Q4,"The Pentagon will provide travel funds and other support for women who seek abortions, a new directive says. WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III issued a directive on Thursday meant to reassure military service members that the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade would not leave troops without access to abortions in states where the procedure had been banned."
Washington,2022,Q4,"In a brief to the court, the Biden administration acknowledged that the end of Title 42 would most likely lead to an increase in border crossings.

Washington,2023,Q2,"Cases dropped after a successful public health campaign last summer. But the disease still has a low-level presence in the city, and many people remain at risk. Late last year, with cases at a trickle, New York City wound down its mpox emergency response. Health officials stopped posting updates about cases. Vaccination vans stopped appearing outside nightclubs. The number of people being vaccinated against the disease flatlined."
Washington,2023,Q2,"A crucial part of the clean energy transition is swept up in the high-pressure negotiations happening in Washington. If the United States can figure out how to quickly build more clean energy, places like Port Arthur, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, may have the most to gain. These communities have for decades shouldered a disproportionate burden of fossil fuel pollution and residents paid dearly with their health. With fewer oil, gas and petrochemical facilities, the air in these communities could get a lot cleaner very soon."
Washington,2023,Q2,"Leaked materials include unsubstantiated intelligence about a Ukrainian politician’s claim that the Russian leader is undergoing chemotherapy. WASHINGTON — For more than a year, the notion that Vladimir V. Putin is seriously ill has been a subject of lurid speculation, internet video forensics — and potential wartime propaganda, even though U.S. officials say there is no evidence the Russian leader is dying."
Washington,2023,Q2,"Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire, is pressing President Biden to remove sanctions that were imposed on him for bribe-fueled transactions in the impoverished African country. WASHINGTON — Five years ago, the United States accused a wealthy Israeli diamond dealer of more than $1 billion worth of corrupt mining and oil deals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, saying they undermined economic growth and “the rule of law” in the impoverished African nation."
Washington,2023,Q2,"Dr. Cohen will replace Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, an infectious disease expert who has overseen the agency since the beginning of Mr. Biden’s term and started a broad effort to reorganize it. President Biden on Friday said that he planned to appoint Dr. Mandy Cohen, the former North Carolina health secretary, as the next director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a widely expected move that marks a major transition at the federal agency tasked with overseeing the nation’s public health infrastructure."
Washington,2023,Q2,"No pretrial hearings have been held at Guantánamo Bay for a year while the Biden administration considers a proposed plea agreement. A military judge is weighing whether to resume hearings in the Sept. 11 case despite two potential hitches: Prosecutors are still awaiting word from the Biden administration on a proposed plea agreement, and a court-ordered examination is underway to determine whether one of the defendants, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, is sane enough to face charges."
Washington,2023,Q2,"Democrats and abortion-rights leaders said the decision could be a catastrophe and used the moment to criticize Republicans, who remained relatively quiet on Friday. As Americans digested a Texas judge’s ruling on Friday night invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone — and a contradictory ruling from a Washington State judge ordering the F.D.A. to maintain its approval as is in some states — the divide in political reactions was as much between words and silence as it was between pro- and anti-abortion rights."
Washington,2023,Q2,"Federal regulators plan to authorize an additional dose for seniors and immunocompromised people in the coming weeks, ahead of the introduction of a newly formulated booster later in the year. WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration plans to allow older and immunocompromised Americans to get a second updated coronavirus booster shot in the near future, an acknowledgment of the virus’s continuing risks to vulnerable people whose immunity might be sagging months after a previous inoculation."
Washington,2023,Q2,"Women’s breasts become less dense with age. Cancer may be more likely in breast tissue that is persistently denser over time, a new study suggests. Scientists have long known that dense breast tissue is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in women. A study published on Thursday in JAMA Oncology adds a new twist, finding that while breast density declines with age, a slower rate of decline in one breast often precedes a cancer diagnosis in that breast."
Washington,2023,Q2,The first-of-its-kind law imposes criminal penalties on anyone who helps a person under 18 leave the state for an abortion and classifies it as “abortion trafficking.” Idaho on Wednesday became the first state to make it illegal for minors to leave the state to get an abortion without parental consent.
Washington,2023,Q3,"The minority leader’s health episode at the Capitol has intensified talk about a possible succession, a prospect that his colleagues have not seriously grappled with for years. It has been decades since there was any real uncertainty at the top of the Republican Party in the Senate. But Senator Mitch McConnell’s alarming freeze-up at a news conference on Wednesday at the Capitol, as well as new disclosures about other recent falls, have shaken his colleagues and intensified quiet discussion about how long he can stay in his position as minority leader, and whether change is coming at the top."
Washington,2023,Q3,Plus tourists buying tickets to attend an Indian wedding. President Volodymyr Zelensky was welcomed at the White House yesterday as President Biden faces pushback from some Republican lawmakers in Congress who oppose providing further assistance to Ukraine.
Washington,2023,Q3,"In an interview with The New York Times, the Pennsylvania senator spoke about the dysfunction in Congress, his health challenges and why he hasn’t traded his loungewear for a business suit. It has been an unusual first six months in Congress for Senator John Fetterman, the 6-foot-8, tattooed Democrat from Pennsylvania, who moved to Washington in January after suffering a near-fatal stroke on the campaign trail last year and going on to win one of the most competitive seats in the midterm elections."
Washington,2023,Q3,"The men are considered the leading candidates to replace the top Senate Republican, should he be forced to step aside for health reasons.

Washington,2023,Q3,"The 81-year-old Senate Republican leader, who had a serious fall earlier this year, was temporarily unable to speak during a news conference, raising questions about his health and future.

Washington,2023,Q3,"Whether their portraits were in oil paint or digital photography, presidents have always sought the same thing: control. Eagerly anticipated and immediately meme-ified, the mug shot of Donald Trump that the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office circulated last week was in some ways utterly conventional: a head-and-shoulders view with unflattering lighting and a law enforcement logo in the corner."
Washington,2023,Q3,"Three people died from infections caused by bacteria that health officials tied to ice cream machines at a Frugals restaurant that they said had not been properly cleaned.

Washington,2023,Q3,"Dr. Paul Friedrichs, a military combat surgeon and retired Air Force general, will lead the new office, which was created by Congress.

Washington,2023,Q3,"The Biden administration is restarting a program that has provided hundreds of millions of free tests through the Postal Service.

Washington,2023,Q4,"Sector-specific pay bumps are a new twist in a state that already has one of the highest hourly minimum wages in the nation. For thousands of Californians, wages are going up."
Washington,2023,Q4,"The health system failed to reach a new contract agreement with many of its unionized employees, who walked off the job in several states. More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers began a three-day strike Wednesday, a job action that could delay medical appointments, lab results and prescriptions for thousands of patients, especially in California."
Washington,2023,Q4,Democrats and Republicans alike are questioning the wisdom of allowing an American industrial icon to fall into foreign hands. The hurdles keep multiplying for U.S. Steel’s proposed $14 billion sale to Nippon Steel of Japan.
Washington,2023,Q4,"Also, Biden and Netanyahu disagree over the war’s next steps. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, trudged across Washington today, making urgent pleas for quick approval of more aid for his country’s war against Russia. But in the meetings that mattered most — with Republican leaders whose allies hold the decisive votes — Zelensky’s pitch appeared to hit a brick wall."
Washington,2023,Q4,"Stocks and bonds have tumbled worldwide, with the 30-year Treasury bill hitting a 16-year high. Investors are worried about the economy’s health. A far-right mutiny on Capitol Hill has sent markets into a tailspin. Skittish investors have dumped stocks and bonds this morning on fears that chaos in the Republican Party will cause a government shutdown next month and all but squash the fleeting hopes of a soft-landing economic recovery heading into an election year."
Washington,2023,Q4,"The proposed settlement follows a three-day strike involving thousands of unionized workers in several states.

Washington,2023,Q4,"“Grounded,” by Jeanine Tesori and George Brant, is premiering at Washington National Opera after attracting criticism over sponsorship.

Washington,2023,Q4,"The National Unity Government of Myanmar, formed as an alternative to the junta that orchestrated a 2021 coup, has to battle global apathy and ignorance as it struggles for recognition. Three blocks from the White House, at the end of a fluorescent-lit hallway on the sixth floor of a co-working space for “business nomads, freelancers and energetic entrepreneurs,” sits the American headquarters of the National Unity Government of Myanmar."
Washington,2023,Q4,"Many Black women report feeling ignored or dismissed by doctors. The consequences can be deadly for mothers and babies. Shakima Tozay was 37 years old and six months pregnant when a nurse, checking the fetal heart rate of the baby boy she was carrying, referred to him as “a hoodlum.”"
Washington,2023,Q4,"Voters’ broad discontent with disarray in Washington transcends political parties, race, age and geography. Whitney Smith’s phone buzzed with a text from her mother, alerting her to the latest can-you-believe-it mess in Washington: “Far right ousted the House speaker. Total chaos now.”"
Washington,2024,Q1,"The Friends Committee, a Quaker lobbying group, has been pushing in Washington for a cease-fire, going up against more powerful and better-funded groups backing Israel. When the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most influential pro-Israel group in the United States, wants to use its muscle, it can call on its considerable resources to run negative ads against lawmakers who oppose its agenda and pour money into funding a challenger."
Washington,2024,Q1,"The president learned only Tuesday that his defense secretary had been diagnosed with prostate cancer a month ago and had surgery under general anesthesia in December, aides said. The White House was caught off guard once again on Tuesday when it learned that Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III had been diagnosed with prostate cancer a month ago and had surgery to treat the disease under general anesthesia on Dec. 22 without notifying either President Biden or his staff."
Washington,2024,Q1,"Despite the explosion in ransomware hacks like the one against Change Healthcare, regulation is spotty and few new safeguards have been proposed to protect patient data, vulnerable hospitals and medical groups. The recent cyberattack on the billing and payment colossus Change Healthcare revealed just how serious the vulnerabilities are throughout the U.S. health care system, and alerted industry leaders and policymakers to the urgent need for better digital security."
Washington,2024,Q1,"The country had made great progress against H.I.V. Now terrified patients have fled clinics, and experts fear a resurgence. For decades, Uganda’s campaign against H.I.V. was exemplary, slashing the country’s death rate by nearly 90 percent from 1990 to 2019. Now a sweeping law enacted last year, the Anti-Homosexuality Act, threatens to renew the epidemic as L.G.B.T.Q. citizens are denied, or are too afraid to seek out, necessary medical care."
Washington,2024,Q1,Volunteers who treated patients in harrowing conditions lobbied American officials on the urgency of an immediate cease-fire. The memories are indelible. Screaming families carrying bloodied loved ones through the doors of an overcrowded hospital. A boy trying to resuscitate a child who looked not much older than himself. A 12-year-old with shrapnel wounds to his head and abdomen being intubated on the ground.
Washington,2024,Q1,"By taking over the federal role in immigration enforcement, Governor Abbott of Texas is welcoming a legal fight with the Biden administration. In mid-December, just one day after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed into law a radical new immigration bill, immigrant rights groups challenged it in court as ridiculously unconstitutional. The groups felt they had no choice, but they did exactly what Texas was counting on, because the point of the law isn’t simply how outrageous it is; it’s about the fight it will cause."
Washington,2024,Q1,"Aaron Bushnell, an active-duty senior airman, repeatedly shouted, “Free Palestine!” as he filmed and livestreamed his protest against Israel’s deadly military actions in Gaza. He had been taken to a hospital on Sunday with life-threatening injuries. An airman who had set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in protest of civilian deaths in Gaza died of his injuries on Sunday night, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air Force, Rose M. Riley, said on Monday."
Washington,2024,Q1,"For over 40 years, he and his organization, the Health Research Group, held government and manufacturers to account for unsafe medication. Sidney M. Wolfe, a physician and consumer advocate who for more than 40 years hounded the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration over high prices, dangerous side effects and overlooked health hazards, bringing a new level of transparency and accountability to the world of medical care, died on Monday at his home in Washington. He was 86."
Washington,2024,Q1,"Americans with Covid or other respiratory infections may return to daily activities if they don’t have a fever and their symptoms are improving.

Washington,2024,Q1,"Health care systems and affordable housing developers have a mutual financial interest in helping communities live healthier. Ce’Yann Irving, a mother of a 1-year-old daughter, pays $990 a month for a two-bedroom apartment on the site of a former dairy processing plant in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans. She has amenities, like a 24-hour gym and an on-site community clinic, at arm’s reach."
Washington,2024,Q2,"The money from Washington, which includes $5 billion to replenish Israel’s defenses and $1 billion for Gazan civilians, comes as Israel readies to invade Rafah.

Washington,2024,Q2,"Prescriptions for social activities, exercise and the arts — first popularized in Britain — are coming to America. But some experts say the U.S. health care system may get in the way. Last spring, Tia Washington, 52, a mother of three in Dublin, Calif., received a stern warning from her doctor: If she didn’t quickly gain control of her high blood pressure, she was likely to end up in the emergency room."
Washington,2024,Q2,"Preliminary numbers show a nearly 4 percent decrease in deaths from opioids, largely fentanyl, but a rise in deaths from meth and cocaine.

Washington,2024,Q2,"The percentages of Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native Americans without insurance have all fallen, often by around half, since the Affordable Care Act took effect, easing disparities in coverage. Uninsured rates among Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native Americans plummeted between 2010 and 2022, according to reports released Friday by the Health and Human Services Department, as more patients gained health coverage from the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces, Medicaid and employer plans."
Washington,2024,Q2,"The lawsuit, brought by the Transgender American Veterans Association, said the Veteran Affairs department’s decision not to offer the procedures was discriminatory.

Washington,2024,Q2,"After repeated attacks from Democrats, Donald Trump, who has often vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said that if elected he would only improve it, without offering specifics. Former President Donald J. Trump said in a video posted to his social media site on Thursday that he was “not running to terminate” the Affordable Care Act, his latest effort to push back on attacks from the Biden campaign and other Democrats over his calls to replace the legislation known as Obamacare."
Washington,2024,Q3,He was once a backer of liberal causes. Then everyone seemed to turn on him. Now he wants to stay away from politics — if that’s possible. It was only a little more than a decade ago that Mark Zuckerberg had few qualms about airing his politics.
Washington,2024,Q3,"More than a million public records were used to assess whether nursing homes were meeting state staffing minimums.

Washington,2024,Q3,The policy has played little role at the Democratic National Convention. Republicans continue to suggest Vice President Kamala Harris would pursue it as president. Democrats promoting the Biden administration’s health care achievements at their convention in Chicago this week have mostly dropped appeals for a policy that split the party during Vice President Kamala Harris’s first presidential campaign: Medicare for All.
Washington,2024,Q3,"The lawsuit takes aim at federal privacy rules, including one enacted this year that Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, called “a backdoor attempt at weakening Texas’ laws.” Texas has sued to block federal rules that prohibit investigators from viewing the medical records of women who travel out of state to seek abortions where the procedure is legal."
Washington,2024,Q3,"Former President Donald J. Trump once promised to replace Obamacare with “something terrific.” But as the 2010 law has become more popular, he has sounded less confident about a repeal. Former President Donald J.

West Virginia,2022,Q1,"The move by several states to lift restrictions comes as a new CBS poll found that a majority of Americans still support mask mandates, including in schools. The governors of Maryland and New Jersey defended their moves to ease Covid restrictions, saying on Sunday that falling coronavirus cases in their states justified a change even as new cases and deaths remain fairly high in some regions of the United States."

In 2019 a wave of anti-abortion laws swept this country — a common enough event in the United States, where hundreds of such laws have passed during the last decade. But these grabbed the public’s attention in a way many others hadn’t. Georgia banned abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, or about two weeks after a missed menstrual period. Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana and Kentucky did the same, while Missouri banned the procedure at eight weeks. Alabama went the furthest, banning virtually all abortions in the state."

West Virginia,2022,Q3,"Now that Joe Manchin has saved the Democratic agenda, how should liberals think about him?

West Virginia,2022,Q4,"The exchange was testier than an earlier debate this week, as the Republican challenger, Joe O’Dea, attacked Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat, as “ineffective” and Mr. Bennet branded his rival “a liar.” Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, and his Republican opponent, Joe O’Dea, battled over abortion rights and gun control on Friday night in a combative debate that was their last face-to-face meeting before the Nov.  8 election.

West Virginia,2023,Q2,"The number leveled off after two years of sharp increases, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

West Virginia,2023,Q2,"Legal scholars say the ruling by a Texas judge, if upheld, could spur disputes over many medications and upend the drug industry’s reliance on the agency. A federal judge’s ruling to revoke the Food and Drug Administration’s longstanding approval of the abortion pill mifepristone poses threats to the U.S. government’s regulatory authority that could go far beyond one drug, legal experts say."
West Virginia,2023,Q2,"The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Friday evening, after congressional passage of legislation to prevent economic calamity.

West Virginia,2023,Q2,"It’s the last in a string of major regulations proposed by the Biden administration to sharply cut the greenhouse gases produced by the United States.

West Virginia,2023,Q3,"Working for New York City, New York State and the U.S. government, he made a career of preparing for the worst and then dealing with it, from 9/11 to hurricanes. Jerome M. Hauer, who as the first director of the Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management oversaw New York City’s response to floods, manhole explosions, mold outbreaks, building collapses, water main breaks, blackouts, hurricanes, sink holes, downed trees, terrorist threats, vermin and the uncertain digital impact on computer networks of Y2K, the turn of the millennium, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 71."
West Virginia,2023,Q3,"Here is a look at five expansive searches that lasted weeks, months or even years before the authorities caught their targets. For more than a week, Danelo Cavalcante, a Brazilian national who was convicted of murder in suburban Philadelphia and then escaped from prison, has eluded an intense manhunt that has grown to hundreds of law enforcement officers."
West Virginia,2023,Q3,"Also, Biden said NATO’s support for Ukraine “will not waver.” Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. The Consumer Price Index — the most widely used measure of inflation in the U.S. economy — climbed 3 percent in the year through June, according to new government data. That is sharply lower than the 9 percent rate at its peak a year ago, offering hope for both consumers and businesses that the recent era of inflated prices will soon be over."
West Virginia,2023,Q3,"PFAS lurk in so much of what we eat, drink and use. Scientists are only beginning to understand how they’re impacting our health — and what to do about them. The Faroe Islands, an incongruous speckling of green in the North Atlantic, are about as far away as you can hope to get on Earth from a toxic-waste dump, time zones distant from the nearest population centers (Norway to the east, Iceland to the west). Pál Weihe was born in the Faroes and has lived there for most of his life. He is a public-health authority for the nation, population around 53,000; chairman of the Faroese Medical Association and chief physician of the Department of Occupational Medicine and Public Health in the Faroese hospital system. He is also vice chairman of the Faroe Islands Art Society; a widower; a grandfather. A crumpled funeral program and half-empty juice boxes share space in the back seat of his Land Cruiser. "

When the torrential rain stopped on Friday afternoon, Laura Lowry could see the steam rising off the wet pavement.

The air-conditioner in her house worked, but she and her husband, reliant on disability checks, couldn’t afford to run it."
West Virginia,2023,Q3,"In rare cases, tests are being used to investigate the outcomes of pregnancies in a country where abortion is effectively banned. Nearly three years ago, Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal effectively ended legal abortion in the country. Since then, the Polish government has vigorously repressed the nation’s reproductive rights movement and ramped up surveillance of women who are suspected of terminating their pregnancies. Authorities have violently dispersed demonstrations, threatened activists with prison time and ordered doctors to record all pregnancies in a new national database."
West Virginia,2023,Q3,"Extreme heat killed 10 people in Laredo, a sign that the eventual death toll from this year’s widespread heat waves could be substantial.

When his body was found, the temperature inside the room was 106 degrees."
West Virginia,2023,Q4,"The administration’s “good neighbor” rule on cross-state pollution, meant to protect downwind states from harmful emissions, faces a legal challenge.

West Virginia,2023,Q4,"The vice president has provided the decisive vote in the Senate 32 times, in a reflection of Democrats’ narrow majority and broader polarization in politics. Vice President Kamala Harris broke the centuries-old record on Tuesday for the most tiebreaking votes cast by a vice president in the Senate, underscoring Democrats’ tenuous hold on the majority and the deep polarization gripping Congress."
West Virginia,2023,Q4,"We have the tools we need to create a world where addiction is just one aspect of people’s lives instead of a dark portal to despair and early death. Raina Mcmahan, a 42-year-old recovery coach, spent roughly half her life seeking treatment for her own opioid use disorder."

West Virginia,2023,Q4,"The shooting in Lewiston that left 18 dead prompted the town’s conservative Democratic representative to embrace an assault weapons ban, but Senators Susan Collins and Angus King are still resisting. The mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, coupled with a conservative Democratic congressman’s reversal on an assault weapons ban, has turned the spotlight on the state’s two senators, Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, and Angus King, a Democrat-leaning independent, both of whom are skeptical about banning military-style rifles."
West Virginia,2023,Q4,"A push from the U.S. for Israel to curtail its bombardment of Gaza.

West Virginia,2023,Q4,"Some older adults are skipping a sun-drenched post-work life and moving instead to the next step: choosing to live near children and grandchildren.

But unable to make a final decision she asked her elder daughter, a college administrator in Richmond, Va., to come north and weigh in."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,Let the third-party follies begin. It seems to be quite the year for third-party presidential candidates.
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"Can an experimental drug cure opioid addiction? Andrew Jacobs, who writes about psychedelic medicine for The Times, explored the “promise and peril” of ibogaine. As a reporter covering psychedelic medicine for the Health and Science desk at The New York Times, the drugs that often command my attention are familiar to any veteran psychonaut: ketamine; LSD; psilocybin, or “magic mushrooms”; and MDMA, also known as Molly or Ecstasy."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"Governments are seeking to curb donkey skin exports to China, where demand for traditional medicine and other products is threatening animals that rural households need. For years, Chinese companies and their contractors have been slaughtering millions of donkeys across Africa, coveting gelatin from the animals’ hides that is processed into traditional medicines, popular sweets and beauty products in China."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"Nearly three dozen House Republicans who supported a federal abortion ban in the last Congress have yet to sign on this year, reflecting a shifting political calculus after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In 2021, Representative Michelle Steel, a California Republican whose district President Biden won in 2020, cosponsored the Life at Conception Act, a bill to recognize a fertilized egg as a person with equal protections under the 14th Amendment."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"In drawing rooms and ballrooms of the elite in Manhattan, any enthusiasm for a second Biden term seemed to be mingled with fear about the thought of a second one for Donald J. Trump. There is one thing a president can do when Congress is an ungovernable mess, polling numbers are blinking red and crises abroad show no signs of resolving themselves. And that thing is: get out of town."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"A bill would ban the sale and use of the traps in New York, but some exterminators say the method is no worse than other ways of killing rodents. When New Yorkers concern themselves with rodents, they typically focus on how to kill them. But a new law proposed in Albany this month aims to protect them from a long-used extermination method now increasingly seen as unduly cruel, even to a rat: trapping them with glue until they starve, die of dehydration or are dispatched by hand."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"The effects of drugs that treat Alzheimer’s, cancer and other illnesses are often limited by the blood-brain barrier. A small study suggests a way forward. There is a problem with the recently approved Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm. It can remove some of the amyloid that forms brain plaques that are hallmarks of the disease. But most of the drug is wasted because it hits an obstacle, the blood-brain barrier, that protects the brain from toxins and infections but also prevents many drugs from entering."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"Why do voters prefer politicians who lie rather than help? Will technological progress lead to mass unemployment? People have been asking that question for two centuries, and the actual answer has always ended up being no. Technology eliminates some jobs, but it has always generated enough new jobs to offset these losses, and there’s every reason to believe that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future."
West Virginia,2024,Q1,Details of a clash between the U.S. secretary of state and Israel’s prime minister point to the challenges ahead. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week with the goals of getting Israel to curtail attacks that are killing thousands of Palestinian civilians and preventing the war from spreading across the region.
West Virginia,2024,Q1,"The future of admissions at selective colleges and high schools has suddenly become clearer. After the Supreme Court banned race-based affirmative action last year, many people in higher education worried that it would be only the first in a series of decisions that reduced diversity at selective schools. In particular, university administrators and professors thought the court might soon ban admissions policies that gave applicants credit for overcoming poverty. Such class-based policies disproportionately help Black, Hispanic and Native students."
West Virginia,2024,Q2,"The step follows an extraordinary move that requires utilities to reduce the levels of carcinogenic PFAS compounds in drinking water to near-zero. The Biden administration is designating two “forever chemicals,” man-made compounds that are linked to serious health risks, as hazardous substances under the Superfund law, shifting responsibility for their cleanup to polluters from taxpayers."
West Virginia,2024,Q2,"Across the country, more intense heat, storms and fires are causing the home insurance market to start to buckle.

When the time came for her to go to school, her parents arranged with school administrators for her to attend as a girl. She used the girls’ bathroom and participated in the girls’ 4-H Club. All in all, she was treated with respect, not bullied or shunned."

Wisconsin,2021,Q3,G.O.P. resistance to public health measures has helped fuel Covid’s resurgence. But the president will be left to clean up the mess.

Wisconsin,2021,Q3,"A new study finds that health care has become the country’s largest source of debt in collections. Those debts are largest where Medicaid wasn’t expanded. Americans owe nearly twice as much medical debt as was previously known, and the amount owed has become increasingly concentrated in states that do not participate in the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion program."

Wisconsin,2021,Q3,"The older cohort had a head start on getting immunized against Covid-19, but too many remain unprotected, experts say. Dr. Won Lee began her initial visit to a new homebound patient, Almeta Trotter, last month by asking about her life, her health and how she was managing in her apartment in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, shared with her longtime partner and a parakeet."
Wisconsin,2021,Q3,"Cases are starting to fall in some hard-hit Southern states, but nearly half of Americans are not fully vaccinated, allowing the Delta variant to persist.

Wisconsin,2021,Q3,"With forfeits possible this year, teams see vaccinations as competitive advantages, prompting locker room campaigns to drive rates higher. INDIANAPOLIS — PJ Mustipher, a defensive tackle for Penn State, peered around Lucas Oil Stadium this summer and let himself imagine the Nittany Lions returning in December to play for a Big Ten title."
Wisconsin,2021,Q4,"We must stop tying our hopes for justice to high-profile criminal cases. When public defenders go to court, we represent people who are routinely referred to as “bodies” and, just as often, treated as such. Many of us wish that the public could witness the degradation and absurdity of everyday legal proceedings."
Wisconsin,2021,Q4,"Cases are shooting up, I.C.U.s are stretched thin and booster vaccinations are lagging. Signs point to an intense winter wave in the United States.

Wisconsin,2021,Q4,"Living longer can mean having a longer career, whether by choice or necessity. Stopping and starting isn’t easy, but it might be worth it. You’re probably going to need to work longer than you imagined when you were first starting out. After all, you might live to be 100."
Wisconsin,2021,Q4,"Rodgers’s return from coronavirus isolation reinforced an N.F.L. axiom: The better the player, the more an organization is willing to endure. GREEN BAY, Wis. — As he himself told the Pat McAfee Show last week, Aaron Rodgers is an athlete, not an activist. So after completing the mandatory 10-day isolation period that accompanied his contracting the coronavirus, Rodgers rejoined the Green Bay Packers and resumed doing what he does well, or best: playing football."
Wisconsin,2021,Q4,"The Green Bay Packers quarterback, one of the most visible athletes in the country, last week used anti-vaccination rhetoric as his reasoning for not getting vaccinated against Covid-19. This spring, he was auditioning to be the host of “Jeopardy!” Nearly every day, he pops up on television ads for national brands like State Farm insurance. And on Sundays this fall, he has led the Green Bay Packers to a division-best 7-2 record."
Wisconsin,2021,Q4,"What the orthopedist saw on the X-rays surprised him. The 17-month-old girl waddled down the hall of the nursing home in her furry pumpkin costume, gripping her Halloween booty. Masaru Furukawa, the child’s next-door neighbor in Spring Green, Wis., as well as her primary-care doctor, had taken his two young children trick-or-treating there, too. Watching his patient, the doctor was struck by her awkward side-to-side gait and bowed legs. “May I take a video of your daughter?” he asked the child’s mother. He wanted to send it to a friend, he explained — a pediatric orthopedist who specialized in children with funny walks."

Public health authorities in Denmark and Norway on Monday released grim projections for the coming wave of the Omicron coronavirus variant, predicting that it will dominate both countries in a matter of days. Although scientists don’t yet know how often the variant causes severe disease, they say its rapid rate of spread will lead to an explosion of cases and could potentially increase pressure on hospitals, even if it proves to be mild."
Wisconsin,2021,Q4,"Institutions who share the Greek names of Covid-19’s “variants of concern” have been getting a bit more attention lately. A few have even leaned into the connection. It’s a strange time to work for Omicron Granite & Tile in Ohio. Or the Omicron Family Restaurant in Wisconsin. Or to be a member of one of the various fraternities, sororities and honor societies whose names feature an “Omicron” — maybe more so if there’s also a “Delta” in there."
Wisconsin,2022,Q1,"A health care company known for hair loss and erectile dysfunction treatments diversifies its product line, and earns new fans along the way.

Wisconsin,2022,Q1,"It never quite fit in your wallet, so it’s no surprise you may have misplaced it by now. More than a year ago, when Covid-19 vaccines became available and jabs started going into arms, it became a point of pride for some people to show off a bandaged shoulder and a white Covid-19 Vaccination Record card."

Wisconsin,2022,Q1,"Ron Johnson has a history of making outlandish comments. But Democrats aren’t focusing on those for now. If you don’t live in Wisconsin, you probably know Ron Johnson as the senator who has suggested gargling with mouthwash to ward off the coronavirus. Or, you might know him as the guy who has said Jan. 6 didn’t “seem like an armed insurrection.” Up until this weekend, he was also the Republican dragging his feet on whether to run for a third Senate term."

Wisconsin,2022,Q2,"An absolute abortion ban that Texas wrote before Roe v. Wade is on hold while a long-ago ban in Wisconsin reaches the courts. A previously blocked six-week ban in Tennessee has taken effect. A state-by-state legal battle in the wake of the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling widened on Tuesday as a judge in Texas temporarily blocked a statewide abortion ban, a federal court let Tennessee tighten existing restrictions, Iowa Republicans said they would ask courts to clear the way for a ban from the moment fetal cardiac activity could be detected, and Wisconsin Democrats announced they were filing suit to halt the resurrection of abortion laws dating to the 19th century."
Wisconsin,2022,Q2,"A survey by election researchers argues that efforts to confuse or scare away prospective voters disproportionately target minority groups in battleground states. When it comes to elections, disinformation is not just a problem online."
Wisconsin,2022,Q2,"Around the country, a patchwork of laws was taking hold amid protest and celebration.

Wisconsin,2022,Q2,"When New York legalized abortion in 1970, nearly two-thirds of New York City’s abortions were for women from elsewhere. If Roe is overturned, a new surge is expected. In the post-Roe America that abortion rights advocates say they have long seen coming, pregnant women in many states will scrape together money, book hotels, arrange child care and board buses, trains and planes bound for places that provide safe abortions. New York will be one of them."
Wisconsin,2022,Q2,"Though their averages of new cases remain lower than during the winter surge, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut are reporting growth in new cases of more than 40 percent over two weeks. Across the United States, officials have dropped mask mandates and are closing mass vaccine and testing sites as new coronavirus cases have fallen nationally to about 27,000 a day on average.

Wisconsin,2022,Q3,"Federal officials are not relying on an established system to distribute the vaccine, slowing immunizations and burdening local health departments, critics say. Roughly 5,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine intended for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., left the national stockpile’s warehouse in Olive Branch, Miss., on July 19. They somehow ended up in Oklahoma."
Wisconsin,2022,Q3,"State abortion bans carry narrow but sometimes vague exceptions, and years of prison time. That’s forcing doctors to think like lawyers, and hospitals to create new protocols. In Wisconsin, a group of doctors and lawyers is trying to come up with guidelines on how to comply with a newly revived 173-year-old law that prohibits abortion except to save the life of a pregnant woman. They face the daunting task of defining all the emergencies and conditions that might result in a pregnant woman’s death, and the fact that doctors could be punished with six years in prison if a prosecutor disagrees that abortion was necessary."

Wisconsin,2022,Q3,"Democrats are defending more than a dozen seats in which the incumbent has said they will not run for re-election, complicating their effort to stop Republicans from reclaiming the House majority. WASHINGTON — Hurrying from the House floor to a waiting car on a recent afternoon, Representative Cheri Bustos, Democrat of Illinois, rattled off an exhaustive analysis of her conservative-leaning district in one minute flat, listing the number of family-owned farms in the area and landing on the argument her party believes could save their House majority: that the Republican running for the seat has “extreme views on women’s health issues.”"
Wisconsin,2022,Q3,"One 10-year-old became the focus of debate, but more than 1,000 girls under 15 seek abortions each year. “How are we going to help the pregnant kids?” She was just 10 years old, so young that many people were horrified when they heard it, and others refused to believe it. But the ordeal of the child rape victim in Ohio who had to cross state lines for an abortion, and the ugly political fight that followed, have highlighted two uncomfortable facts: Such pregnancies are not as rare as people think, and new abortion bans are likely to have a pronounced impact on the youngest pregnant girls."
Wisconsin,2022,Q3,"The second-term Democrat was the first openly gay woman elected to Congress. Now she is leading the effort to rally Republican support for legislation that would protect marriage equality nationwide. WASHINGTON — Senator Tammy Baldwin, the soft-spoken liberal Democrat of Wisconsin, was on a plane home from Washington last month when she got word that Senator Ron Johnson, her home-state colleague and a stridently hard-right Republican, had said publicly that he would not oppose a bill protecting same-sex marriage rights."
Wisconsin,2022,Q3,"Surgical procedures and medication for miscarriages are identical to those for abortion, and some patients report delayed or denied miscarriage care because doctors and pharmacists fear running afoul of abortion bans. Last year, a 35-year-old woman named Amanda, who lives in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, had a miscarriage in the first trimester of her pregnancy. At a large hospital, a doctor performed a surgical procedure often used as a safe and quick method to remove tissue from a failed pregnancy."

Despite Republican‌ assurances that their draconian abortion bans wouldn’t hurt women, a flood of heart-wrenching accounts from across the country prove otherwise. Yet even with that outpouring of stories, plus polls showing broad opposition to the bans and an increase in women registering to vote, it’s still unclear if the issue will be the deciding factor for voters in the midterm elections on Tuesday."

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"What should we make of the role that abortion played in both the Chicago and Wisconsin elections this week? The elections this week in Chicago and Wisconsin were different in many ways. One was for mayor, the other for a state Supreme Court seat.

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"Some in the party are urging compromise, warning of dire electoral consequences for 2024, while other stances, on guns and gay rights, also risk turning off moderates.

Wisconsin,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults.

Black women, they found, were dying at even more elevated rates. Data in hand, they called for change."
Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"A federal gun law passed last year gave the Biden administration a powerful new tool to increase background checks on “private” firearms sales. Will the administration use it?

Wisconsin,2023,Q3,"The Democratic presidential challenger continues to espouse extreme ideas, but has dialed that messaging back in large public forums. In an online meeting with anti-vaccine activists on June 27, Robert F.

Wisconsin,2023,Q4,"With post-Roe outrage showing no sign of waning, strategists on the right are pushing a new lexicon on abortion. In the year since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the Republican Party has tested out constantly changing talking points and messages on abortion in an attempt to make its anti-abortion policies sound less extreme. Conservatives are even considering moving away from the term “pro-life,” fearing that voters have newly negative associations with the label."

In record-setting heat in Texas this past summer, Mr. Soto, who has epilepsy, had four more seizures that left him speechless, his body unresponsive, he said."
Wisconsin,2023,Q4,"Tuesday’s election on an abortion-related ballot initiative could have consequences beyond the state. By Nov. 7, my fellow Ohioans will cast votes on Issue 1, a ballot initiative that would secure access to reproductive health care, including abortion. It is the only statewide election specifically about reproductive rights in 2023. Whichever way the vote goes, both sides of the debate are likely to draw lessons about abortion-related strategy for next year, when several more ballot initiatives are expected."

Wisconsin,2023,Q4,"Despite his bad poll numbers, I see a path to victory for Biden. Well, this week has been an emotional roller coaster. On Sunday, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed President Biden behind Donald Trump in a bunch of battleground states, sending Democrats into a tizzy. Then on Tuesday, voters handed Democrats a string of election victories — the kind they have enjoyed in election after election since Trump was inaugurated in 2017."

Wisconsin,2024,Q1,"The new obesity drugs might be an exception to a chronic, deadly problem: the failure to stick with medication.

Either patients never start taking them, or they stop."
Wisconsin,2024,Q1,"Representative Adam Schiff and the former M.L.B. player Steve Garvey will face off in November for a U.S. Senate seat. A number of races from Tuesday’s primary election in California remain too close to call, but the most-watched contest is a done deal."

Wisconsin,2024,Q2,"But the scope of the outbreak among cattle remains uncertain, and little human testing has been done. Additional testing of retail dairy products from across the country has turned up no signs of live bird flu virus, strengthening the consensus that pasteurization is protecting consumers from the threat, federal health and agriculture officials said at a news briefing on Wednesday."
Wisconsin,2024,Q2,"Most of the party’s leaders want to avoid too much focus on Donald Trump’s felonies. JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, feels differently. When former President Donald J.

Wisconsin,2024,Q2,"Farmworkers have been exposed to milk infected with the bird flu virus. But there has been virtually no testing on farms, and health officials know little about who may be infected.

Wisconsin,2024,Q2,"After weeks of tumult over protests, many college administrators prepared themselves for disruptions. But several ceremonies unfolded without major incident. At the University of California, Berkeley, hundreds of soon-to-be graduates rose from their seats in protest, chanting and disrupting their commencement.

Wyoming,2021,Q2,"The court sidestepped the larger issue in the case, whether the 2010 health care law can stand without a provision that required most Americans to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. WASHINGTON — The Affordable Care Act on Thursday survived a third major challenge as the Supreme Court, on a 7-to-2 vote, turned aside the latest effort by Republicans to kill the health care law."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"Dick Cheney always saw doomsday threats from America’s enemies. His daughter is in a lonely battle against what both see as a danger to American democracy: Donald J. Trump.

Wyoming,2021,Q2,"The state, which lifted all its pandemic restrictions in March, has seen a 21 percent increase in its daily new-case average in recent weeks. While most of the United States has seen a steady decline in new coronavirus cases recently, Arizona has been an outlier."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"The pandemic barely dented the financial outlook for some major networks, which continued to acquire weaker hospitals and ailing doctors’ practices. Critics worry consolidation leads to higher prices for medical care. Billions of dollars in Covid aid cushioned financial losses caused by the pandemic at some of the nation’s largest hospital chains. But those bailouts also helped sustain the big chains’ spending sprees as they expanded even more by scooping up weakened competitors and doctors’ practices."

Wyoming,2021,Q2,"Production problems and a brief pause on its use kept the one-dose vaccine from becoming the game changer that health officials across the country believed it would be. WASHINGTON — When Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose coronavirus vaccine was authorized for emergency use in late February, ​it was seen as a breakthrough for reaching vulnerable and isolated Americans, a crucial alternative to vaccines that require two shots weeks apart and fussier storage. It was soon popular on college campuses, in door-to-door campaigns and with harder-to-reach communities that often struggle with access to health care."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"Private colleges make up the bulk of the schools with vaccine mandates, but some public universities have also moved to require shots, according to a survey by The New York Times. More than 100 colleges across the United States have said they will require students to receive coronavirus vaccines in order to attend in-person classes in the fall, according to a New York Times survey."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"The shift away from high-volume centers is an acknowledgment of the harder road ahead: a highly targeted push, akin to get-out-the-vote efforts, to persuade the reluctant to get shots. NEWARK — There were only six tiny vials of coronavirus vaccine in the refrigerator, one Air Force nurse on duty and a trickle of patients on Saturday morning at a federally run mass vaccination site here. A day before its doors shut for good, this once-frenetic operation was oddly quiet."
Wyoming,2021,Q2,"Speaking at the White House, the president did not mention his goal of getting 70 percent of adults partly vaccinated by July 4 but trumpeted a different milestone: 300 million shots in his first 150 days in office. WASHINGTON — With the United States unlikely to reach his self-imposed deadline of having 70 percent of adults partly vaccinated against the coronavirus by July 4, President Biden on Friday stepped up his drive for Americans to get their shots, warning that those who decline risk becoming infected by a highly contagious and potentially deadly variant."

Wyoming,2021,Q3,"In remarks on Friday, the president said his mandates would prevail and expressed disappointment with Republican governors who “have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of their communities.” Republican governors across the country assailed President Biden’s aggressive moves to require vaccinations as an unconstitutional attack on personal freedoms and vowed to sue the administration to block the requirements."
Wyoming,2021,Q3,"A top White House adviser said monoclonal antibody treatments, sometimes underused, could still be crucial in helping people with Covid-19 avoid getting very sick. WASHINGTON — Facing overcrowded hospitals and an unrelenting surge of Delta variant cases around the country, the Biden administration on Thursday renewed its call for health providers to use monoclonal antibody treatments, which can help Covid-19 patients who are at risk of getting very sick."
Wyoming,2021,Q3,"As companies navigate vaccine requirements, a high-profile Silicon Valley trial is set to begin. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for people 16 and older, kicking off a new wave of company vaccine mandates. Delta Air Lines announced a new approach to encouraging, rather than requiring, employees to take the vaccine: Starting Nov. 1, unvaccinated workers will have to pay an additional $200 per month to remain on the company’s health care plan. It’s unclear how effective the policy will be. Studies of employer wellness programs that promote healthy behavior, such as quitting smoking, by offering rewards or imposing penalties have shown little effect on employee health. But employees may respond differently to a program focused on vaccination, which doesn’t require a long-term behavior change."
Wyoming,2021,Q3,"But the tortuous path it’s taken highlights the obstacles to expanding the low-income health program in other states where it has not been welcomed. The Missouri Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Medicaid expansion to go forward there, ruling unanimously Thursday that the state legislature must fund the new program.

Wyoming,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit was filed a day after the announcement of a Jan. 4 deadline for the companies to begin their mandates or start weekly testing. The attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday in an effort to prevent the Biden administration from requiring large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations, the latest sign of growing pushback against the federal government’s biggest effort yet to enlist private businesses in combating the virus."
Wyoming,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit is being led by Missouri’s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, and the attorney general of Nebraska, Doug Peterson. Ten Republican-led states filed a lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Missouri accusing the Biden administration of a broad range of overreaches in mandating that employees of federal contractors be vaccinated against the coronavirus by Dec. 8."

Wyoming,2022,Q1,"The Supreme Court will hear from two convicted pill mill doctors in cases that could have significant implications for physicians’ latitude to prescribe addictive painkillers. For years, Dr. Xiulu Ruan was one of the nation’s top prescribers of quick-release fentanyl drugs. The medicines were approved only for severe breakthrough pain in cancer patients, but Dr. Ruan dispensed them almost exclusively for more common ailments: neck aches, back and joint pain. According to the Department of Justice, he and his partner wrote almost 300,000 prescriptions for controlled substances from 2011 to 2015, filled through the doctors’ own pharmacy in Mobile, Ala. Dr. Ruan often signed prescriptions without seeing patients, prosecutors said."

It’s also an indicator on how vulnerable Los Angeles remains to the coronavirus."
Wyoming,2022,Q1,"Drawing on childhood grammar lessons, the justices considered whether the doctors were entitled to argue that they had acted in good faith. WASHINGTON — Against the backdrop of a national crisis of soaring opioid overdoses and deaths, the Supreme Court on Tuesday considered the cases of two doctors accused of operating pill mills, with the justices struggling to articulate a legal standard that would separate unconventional medical practices from drug dealing."

Wyoming,2022,Q1,"For the past 10 years, wolves have been steadily returning to the state after being wiped out a century ago. But not everyone is rolling out the welcome mat. Kent Laudon, a wolf biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, woke up one morning last year to a flurry of text messages from a rancher in the state’s northernmost county. He was asking about a post with wildly specific details spreading across Facebook that urged people to find a red truck that was transporting breeding wolves along Route 97 into Siskiyou County, Calif. Mr. Laudon was not surprised. This wasn’t the first post of its kind, and it wouldn’t be the last."
Wyoming,2022,Q1,"The lack of consequences for Republican leaders over Jan. 6 has Democrats worried for the future.  But some also expressed empathy for the rioters.

The F.B.I. started airing a radio ad last week seeking information about the fatal shooting of a man in Naschitti, N.M., within the Navajo Nation."
Wyoming,2022,Q2,"Anti-abortion laws that don’t prioritize women’s health. In December, I wrote a newsletter with the headline, “Overturning Roe Will Make Miscarriage Care Worse.” I pointed out that because the options that doctors have to end a miscarriage that doesn’t happen on its own — medication or surgery — are the same ones involved in an abortion, outlawing abortion would have a chilling effect on medical providers, as evidenced by cases in countries such as Malta and Poland where abortion is severely restricted."

Wyoming,2022,Q3,"Information and medications needed to end a pregnancy are increasingly available outside the health care system.

As consumers’ whims continue to evolve in the pandemic recovery, many companies that once enjoyed high-highs are feeling the sting of low-lows. That is especially true for the exercise bike company Peloton, which reported a $1.2 billion quarterly loss on Thursday — its sixth straight quarter of losses. After a pandemic boom, Peloton is now among the many retailers struggling to sell excess inventory. But its stationary bikes, priced at $1,445 and now available on Amazon, may still be a hard sell: Other earnings reports, like those from Dollar General and Dollar Tree this week, pointed to more cautious consumer spending. The two companies, the largest dollar-store chains in the country, posted higher sales and profits in their latest quarter as inflation eats into Americans’ budgets. In the past year, a majority of new customers shopping at Dollar Tree earned at least $80,000 annually, according to the company’s chief executive — a sign that even higher earners are looking for bargains."

Wyoming,2023,Q4,"A variety of common canine pathogens, none of them new, could be driving the recent outbreaks. Scientists and health officials are scrambling to find an explanation for the outbreaks of severe respiratory illness that have been sickening dogs across the United States."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"We have the tools we need to create a world where addiction is just one aspect of people’s lives instead of a dark portal to despair and early death. Raina Mcmahan, a 42-year-old recovery coach, spent roughly half her life seeking treatment for her own opioid use disorder."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"A major government assessment lays out both the far-reaching perils of global warming and the cost-effective fixes that are available today. The food we eat and the roads we drive on. Our health and safety. Our cultural heritage, natural environments and economic flourishing. Nearly every cherished aspect of American life is under growing threat from climate change and it is effectively too late to prevent many of the harms from worsening over the next decade, a major report from the federal government has concluded."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"A report that terror groups raised more than $130 million in crypto during recent years has set off a debate in Washington and finance circles. The United States will go after cryptocurrency firms that fail to stop terrorist groups from moving money, the U.S. deputy Treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, warned on Friday."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"A conversation with the Times reporter Delger Erdenesanaa, who helped lead an investigation on the poor oversight of our country’s aquifers. Groundwater is one of America’s most precious resources. The water that fills wells, stored naturally in underground aquifers, allowed vast cities to emerge and turned the nation into an agricultural powerhouse."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"Jeanine Tesori and George Brant’s “Grounded,” which Washington National Opera premiered on Saturday, is headed to the Metropolitan Opera next year. The young mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo has a wide grin, haunted eyes and a mellow, confident voice that flashes with lean anxiety. In tone and presence, she’s driven, intense, wry. Onstage she’s unsentimental — and unsettled."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"When not driving around, electric buses and other vehicles could help utilities by storing their solar and wind energy and releasing it to meet surges in demand. The four vehicles parked at a depot in South Burlington, Vt., look no different from the yellow school buses familiar to millions of schoolchildren. But beneath their steel shells, these buses are packed with technology that could be vital in the transition to clean energy."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"How Adidas looked past misconduct in its partnership with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. When Adidas ended its wildly lucrative shoe deal with Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, a year ago, the breakup appeared to be the culmination of weeks of his inflammatory remarks about Jews and Black Lives Matter. But our examination found that behind the scenes, the partnership was fraught from the start."
Wyoming,2023,Q4,What would you do if you won the lottery? How do we stop having this same fight about money? And much more. This article is part of a Modern Love project on the intersection of money and relationships.
Wyoming,2023,Q4,"The Natural Resources Defense Council is eliminating its longstanding program promoting nuclear safety and cleanup as donors focus on the climate crisis. A significant shift in donor contributions to nonprofits fighting climate change in recent years has left some of the nation’s biggest environmental organizations facing critical shortfalls in programs on toxic chemicals, radioactive contamination and wildlife protection."
Wyoming,2024,Q1,"How did gender become a scary word? The theorist who got us talking about the subject has answers. The first thing I did when reading Judith Butler’s new book, “Who’s Afraid of Gender?”, was to look up the word “phantasm,” which appears 41 times in the introduction alone. (It means illusion; the “phantasm of gender,” a threat rooted in fear and fantasy.)"
Wyoming,2024,Q1,"Pushed by an advocacy group, Arkansas became the first state to shield noisy cryptocurrency operators from unhappy neighbors. A furious backlash has some lawmakers considering a statewide ban. On a sweltering July evening, the din from thousands of computers mining for Bitcoins pierced the night.

Wyoming,2024,Q1,"The “Ally McBeal” star takes on the darker, dagger-like role of Lee Radziwill in “Feud.” On a chilly January weekend in Los Angeles, I turned into a truffle pig. I foraged relentlessly all over town, looking for truffle fries."
Wyoming,2024,Q1,"The explosion of the e-commerce economy has created an opportunity for thieves — and a conundrum for the railways. Of all the dozens of suspected thieves questioned by the detectives of the Train Burglary Task Force at the Los Angeles Police Department during the months they spent investigating the rise in theft from the city’s freight trains, one man stood out. What made Victor Llamas memorable wasn’t his criminality so much as his giddy enthusiasm for trespassing. He was a self-taught expert of the supply chain, a connoisseur of shipping containers. Even in custody, as the detectives interrogated him numerous times, after multiple arrests, in a windowless police-station room in the spring of 2022, a kind of nostalgia would sweep over the man. “He said that was the best feeling he’d ever had, jumping on the train while it was moving,” Joe Chavez, who supervised the task force’s detectives, told me. “It was euphoric for him.” "
Wyoming,2024,Q1,Readers discuss the costs and benefits. Also: Donald Trump’s remark about American Jews and Israel; subway shootings; abortion providers; FAFSA chaos. To the Editor:
Wyoming,2024,Q2,"Out-of-state trips for abortions more than doubled in 2023, demonstrating the upheaval in access since the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Out-of-state trips for abortions more than doubled in 2023, demonstrating the upheaval in access since the overturn of Roe v. Wade."
Wyoming,2024,Q2,"The polarization of politics means that rules are imposed, gutted and restored with each election. Experts say that’s bad for the economy. The Biden administration’s move on Thursday to strictly limit pollution from coal-burning power plants is a major policy shift. But in many ways it’s one more hairpin turn in a zigzag approach to environmental regulation in the United States, a pattern that has grown more extreme as the political landscape has become more polarized."
Wyoming,2024,Q2,"Instead of continuing the environmental legacy they were once known for, Republicans have ceded the fight against climate change to Democrats. Conservatives were once America’s environmental champions. Not that long ago, Republican presidents were carrying out the Clean Air and Water Acts, creating the Environmental Protection Agency, expanding the National Park System and even initiating the country’s most authoritative report on climate change, the National Climate Assessment."
Wyoming,2024,Q2,"A Delaware family sees itself in the Hunter Biden story. Kim Jones lives in a neat house on a road lined with cattails and lilies near the Delaware River with three dogs, four cats, her new husband, her 19-year-old daughter, Hannah, and her father, Curt. Kim has planted blueberries in the backyard and plans to start keeping bees. A wooden sign in the window of her garage conveys her hope for the future: “Honey For Sale.”"
Wyoming,2024,Q2,"A total eclipse is worth moving heaven and earth to experience. If all goes according to plan, on Monday, our 75-year-old mother, Nancy, will be settled into a lawn chair in Waco, Texas — some 1,300 miles from her recliner in Las Vegas — and joining a great many other Americans as they put on solar eclipse glasses, tilt their heads up and try to make sense of what’s happening in the heavens."
Wyoming,2024,Q2,"Also, Donald Trump said abortion limits should be decided by states. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday. In an awe-inspiring cosmic coincidence, the moon and sun perfectly aligned this afternoon, producing a total solar eclipse visible across North America. The moon’s shadow plunged daylight into darkness, carving a path from Mexico, up to Maine and into Canada. We took lots of photos."
Wyoming,2024,Q2,"The first-term Pennsylvanian has battled with progressives on Israel, immigration and energy, adopting a more caustic political persona and alienating some supporters. Senator John Fetterman was hard to miss, lumbering down an empty hallway in a Senate office building dressed in his signature baggy gym shorts and a black hoodie. So when Stevie O’Hanlon, an environmentalist and organizer from Chester County, Pa., spotted him recently, she took the opportunity to question her home-state senator about a pipeline in her community."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"The cost of living may not be the G.O.P.’s, um, trump card. Last week was full of speeches. Most of those that attracted national attention were at the Democratic National Convention, culminating in Vice President Kamala Harris’s big moment on Thursday. But there was another important speech on Friday: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s talk at the Fed’s annual shindig in Jackson Hole, Wyo."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"The U.S. economy has added roughly 19 million jobs in four years. But as of the end of 2023, 43 percent of counties still hadn’t regained all the jobs they lost in the early months of the pandemic. The U.S. economy has added roughly 19 million jobs in four years.

Wyoming,2024,Q3,"One student’s turbulent coming-out journey in the 1990s put Mr. Walz, then a football coach, at the center of gay rights in a Minnesota high school. Taunts and threats escalated as rumors about Jacob Reitan’s sexual orientation swirled around his southern Minnesota high school during his senior year in 1999."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"It’s a change from 2016, when House Republicans were the preferred candidates. At least two senators — J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio — are on the short list for the vice president slot. After Donald J. Trump was elected president in 2016, he reached into the Senate for just one high-level member of his administration, picking Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general and rewarding the first senator to endorse him when many other Republicans had kept the candidate at arm’s length."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"U.S. employers added 114,000 jobs in July, far short of forecasts, and unemployment rose to 4.3 percent, the highest level since 2021. American employers reined in their hiring significantly in July, intensifying jitters that the economy is cooling faster than expected."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"Inflation is cooling but hiring is slowing as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump fine tune their pitch to voters. As Vice President Kamala Harris hits the road to start spelling out her economic agenda, she could point to recent progress in the inflation fight that has hounded the Biden administration and Democrats for the past two years."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,Here’s what you need to know. The presidential election is less than 90 days away. This is what we’re watching.
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"With the political conventions behind us and a rate cut expected soon, the market has been rallying, yet our columnist says it’s safer to play a longer game. The stock market not only has recovered from its tantrum of early August, it is behaving as though that downturn never happened."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"Heading into the Democratic National Convention, many of the vice president’s policies have yet to be explained. Corporate leaders hope that will change. The center of the national conversation this week turns to Chicago, as the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off on Monday."
Wyoming,2024,Q3,"Many Democrats endorsed the vice president as their party’s standard-bearer, but some donors questioned whether more competition for the role was needed. The shock waves from President Biden ending his re-election bid, after weeks of pressure to step aside, are still reverberating around the world."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"A deadly outbreak spurred removal of onions by a major food supplier in the Mountain West. Taco Bell, KFC, Burger King and Pizza Hut have stopped serving onions at various locations. A sweeping onion recall linked to an E. coli outbreak involving McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has prompted several other major fast-food chains to remove raw onions from their menu offerings."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"But Liz Cheney, his highest-profile Republican detractor, was not among those celebrating his win. She emphasized that Americans “must ensure that our institutions hold over these coming four years.” Top Republicans celebrated President-elect Donald J. Trump’s victory, and even some of his critics in the party congratulated him on Wednesday, while Democrats largely remained quiet as they awaited remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"In a wide-ranging interview, the vice president also she could not think of a way she would act differently from President Biden, and laid out a plan to help Americans take care of aging loved ones. Vice President Kamala Harris, kicking off a daylong blitz of news media interviews, assailed former President Donald J. Trump for what she called his “callousness” in responding to the deadly storms that have ravaged southeastern states, and said she was still hoping to work with Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida, as his state faces the latest monster hurricane."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"A new analysis shows how many women in states with bans are seeking procedures or pills from out-of-state providers. In nearly every state that has banned abortion, the number of women receiving abortions increased between 2020 and the end of 2023, according to the most comprehensive account of all abortions by state since the overturning of Roe v. Wade."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"Two weeks to the U.S. election. With two weeks to go before Americans head to the polls, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are running neck and neck, Nate Cohn, The Times’s chief political analyst, writes."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"The president appeared to slip by suggesting he wanted his predecessor put behind bars, but revised his comment to say he meant locked up “politically.” President Biden said on Tuesday that former President Donald J. Trump was a threat to democracy and should be locked up, before quickly amending his comment to say he meant locked up “politically.”"
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"The president-elect could reshape government and may dramatically transform foreign and domestic policy in a second term. As he declared victory, President-elect Donald J. Trump said that his mission now was nothing less than to “save our country.” His version of doing that involves an expansive agenda that would reshape government, foreign policy, national security, economics and domestic affairs as dramatically as any president in modern times."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"The president-elect’s choice of combative loyalists who could have trouble being confirmed has raised constitutional questions about executive power and the Senate’s prerogatives. President-elect Donald J. Trump’s bid to stock his cabinet with combative loyalists is creating the first major test for the new Senate Republican majority, whose leaders must now decide how far they are willing to go to challenge nominees some of them regard as egregiously unfit."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"After reports that the team includes a transgender player, several schools have forfeited matches against the university out of protest. The San Jose State University women’s volleyball team is trying to make the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time in 23 years. But first, it must find schools willing to play against it."
Wyoming,2024,Q4,"President-elect Donald J. Trump’s transition team for climate and the environment is considering relocating the E.P.A. out of Washington and other drastic changes. As President-elect Donald J. Trump’s transition team plans his energy and environment agenda, it is relying on two seasoned former cabinet leaders and fossil fuel lobbyists to dramatically reshape the agencies charged with protecting the nation’s air, water, climate and public lands, according to six people familiar with the matter."
