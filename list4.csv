New Mexico,2021,Q4,"The U.S. should move from a border policy approach to a truly regional and collaborative plan of action. While U.S. attention on immigration has been focused mostly on the large number of Central Americans arriving at the southwestern border over the past few years, the biggest migration flows in the hemisphere are actually happening farther to the south. As the arrival of thousands of Haitians in Del Rio, Texas, last month showed, the United States may well start seeing many more migrants from countries outside the Northern Triangle nations of Central America."
New Mexico,2022,Q1,"The moratorium’s end presents Gov. Kathy Hochul with a potential challenge as she prepares to run for a full term.

New Mexico,2022,Q1,"The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on what people owe long-term domestic workers. I have had the same woman come once a week to clean my house for the past 10 years. Several times a year — amounting to between 10 to 15 percent of her scheduled days — she gets a migraine and cancels for the week, always at the last minute. She is a one-woman operation, so there is no one else to come in her place. I realize not having someone come to clean your house is not the world’s biggest tragedy, but it does leave me in the lurch with either cleaning projects left undone or a scramble to get done things I had not planned on having to do. I don’t believe she is lying to me about feeling unwell. And it is, of course, reasonable to expect people to be ill once in a while, but is there such a thing as too often — i.e., can I let her go and find someone else that would be more reliable because she gets sick too often?

New Mexico,2022,Q2,"Immersive art, bespoke hotels and restaurants that range from Creole to a ‘tropical roadhouse’ are only a few of the offerings awaiting visitors.

New Mexico,2022,Q2,"A wave of parents has been radicalized by Covid-era misinformation to reject ordinary childhood immunizations — with potentially lethal consequences. The mother of four brought her children, ranging in age from grade school to high school, to the doctor’s office last summer for their annual checkup. When their pediatrician, Robert Froehlke, said that it was time for shots and several boosters and then mentioned the Covid vaccine, her reaction stunned him. “I’m not going to kill my children,” Froehlke recalls her saying, as she began to shake and weep. He ushered her out of the examination room, away from her children, and tried to calm her. “We’re just trying to help your kids be healthy,” he told her. But he didn’t press the issue; he sensed that she wasn’t persuadable at that moment. And he didn’t want to drive her away from his practice altogether. “That really shook me up,” he says."

New Mexico,2022,Q3,"The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on abortion quickly led to bans in at least eight states, a shift toward criminalization that runs counter to recent easings in countries that had longstanding bans.

HELP.”"
New Mexico,2022,Q4,"Plans to lift Title 42 have prompted dire predictions of chaos on the border. But there is already a migrant surge, because the pandemic policy was never an effective border-control tool. EL PASO, Texas — For months, migrants from Nicaragua and Colombia, toddlers on their shoulders and knapsacks on their backs, have been wading across the shallow waters of the Rio Grande near El Paso and forming lines to turn themselves in to U.S. border authorities.

New Mexico,2023,Q2,"In “Nine Black Robes,” Joan Biskupic traces the rise of the Supreme Court’s triumphant and aggressive supermajority. Though his troubles with the judicial system are legion, Donald Trump has shown a surprising reverence for judges. “Apart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court justice is the most important decision an American president can make,” he said in September 2020, when he released “a specific list of the individuals” he was considering for the Supreme Court and dared his opponent Joe Biden to do the same."
New Mexico,2023,Q2,"Outdated immigration laws, partisan gridlock and conflict abroad are some reasons behind the strained U.S. border with Mexico. President Biden’s tenure has coincided with a global rise in migration, and the pressure has been felt acutely at the United States’ southern border. Officials caught migrants crossing the border without authorization more than five million times from February 2021 to March this year, according to the most recent data available — the highest number of arrests in decades."
New Mexico,2023,Q2,"First the city tried hotels, then tents, then a cruise ship terminal, then school gyms. As migrants have continued to cross the border, the mayor pleaded on Wednesday for understanding — and ideas. Since tens of thousands of migrants began arriving in New York City last year, the administration of Mayor Eric Adams has searched for one place after another to house them: hotels, parking lots, a cruise ship terminal and a pair of giant tents on Randall’s Island among them. Almost every idea has caused an uproar."

New Mexico,2023,Q4,"The influx of migrants is taxing the social safety net in the U.S. Will Democrats pay the price for it? For far too long, too many Americans considered the border to be someone else’s problem — someone in Texas, maybe, or Arizona or California. People who didn’t live near the border might have condemned harsh tactics used there or offered their communities as sanctuaries for those who managed to slip across it. But for the most part, the challenges of the border remained at the border. Out of sight, out of mind."

New Mexico,2023,Q4,"On Wednesday, 20 Americans, all anonymously nominated, were recognized by the MacArthur Foundation with $800,000 fellowships often referred to as the “genius” award. Patrick Makuakane, a hula choreographer in San Francisco, was at the Burning Man festival when he received a text from someone who claimed to be from the MacArthur Foundation and had been trying to reach him.

The drug comes from the bark of the root, which is crushed and consumed as a powder or given in an extracted form."
New Mexico,2024,Q1,"Cases have risen by 80 percent since 2018, the C.D.C. reported. But chlamydia remains far more common.

New Mexico,2024,Q1,"As public health groups pressure the Biden administration to impose a ban on menthol cigarettes, research suggests similar moves in other countries have led to lower smoking rates.

New Mexico,2024,Q2,"A genetic analysis sheds light on when the outbreak began, how the virus spread and where it may be going. The bird flu virus sweeping across dairy farms in multiple states has acquired dozens of new mutations, including some that may make it more adept at spreading between species and less susceptible to antiviral drugs, according to a new study."
New Mexico,2024,Q2,"The National Institutes of Health, which owns the chimps at the Alamogordo Primate Facility in New Mexico, has no plans to move the animals to sanctuary, despite a ruling from a federal judge. It has been more than two decades since chimpanzee research came to a halt at the Alamogordo Primate Facility in New Mexico. And yet, some two dozen chimps still live there, despite a federal law that requires such retired research chimps to be moved to sanctuary."
New Mexico,2024,Q2,"Despite an arsenal of drugs, many Americans are still unaware of their infections until it’s too late. A Biden initiative languishes without Congressional approval. In the 10 years since the drugmaker Gilead debuted a revolutionary treatment for hepatitis C, a wave of new therapies have been used to cure millions of people around the world of the blood-borne virus."
New Mexico,2024,Q2,"In a visit supported by the U.S. government, a group of Mexican experts came to British Columbia to discuss ways of responding to rampant opioid deaths. A machine used for chemical analysis, with a slight resemblance to a printer, thrummed repeatedly as technicians at a drug testing site in Victoria, British Columbia, prepared to open its doors to local drug users."
New Mexico,2024,Q2,"Whether you’re a casual moviegoer or an avid buff, our reviewers think these films are worth knowing about. A dog and his robot friend explore 1980s New York in this wordless cartoon written and directed by Pablo Berger and adapted from the graphic novel of the same name."
New Mexico,2024,Q2,"Speaker Mike Johnson should let the House vote on extending and expanding RECA, and our lawmakers should vote yes. The men and women came to Capitol Hill last week bearing surgical scars, long medical histories and fading photographs of loved ones long dead. They came from across the country to walk the halls of Congress and show lawmakers the human cost of the U.S. nuclear weapons program."
New Mexico,2024,Q2,"People all over the world are facing severe heat, floods and fire, aggravated by the use of fossil fuels. The year isn’t halfway done. Poll workers. Pilgrims. Tourists on a hike."
New Mexico,2024,Q2,"The women underwent the cosmetic procedure at an unlicensed spa in New Mexico. At least three women were infected with H.I.V. during cosmetic “vampire facial” procedures at an unlicensed spa in Albuquerque, federal officials said Thursday.

New Mexico,2024,Q2,"India’s many problems can’t be solved by his radical Hindu nationalism. The sleepy pilgrimage city of Ayodhya in northern India was once home to a grand 16th-century mosque, until it was illegally demolished by a howling mob of Hindu militants in 1992. The site has since been reinvented as the centerpiece of the Hindu-chauvinist “new India” promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"The path to a life in a new country is often paved with complicated visa and residency requirements. Americans can travel to scores of countries without getting a visa in advance, making the United States passport among the most coveted in the world. But while it’s relatively easy to plan a vacation abroad, planning a permanent move is often complicated, protracted and uncertain."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"A former F.D.A. commissioner thinks we’ve ignored two crucial avenues that are fueling the opioid crisis. More than 80,000 Americans each year are dying from fentanyl as the opioid epidemic has morphed into a grimmer, more sinister threat. What began as a crisis fueled by the reckless prescribing of painkillers has now become a deadly illicit trade in counterfeit OxyContin or Vicodin pills containing fentanyl at wildly inconsistent dosages. Depending on the amount of fentanyl used, even a single pill can be lethal."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,The total in federal grants to create a dozen “tech hubs” in regions beyond Silicon Valley and the coasts. The Biden administration this week awarded $504 million to 12 regions in states from New Mexico to New Hampshire with the goal of transforming overlooked communities into “tech hubs.”
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"After the fall of Roe v. Wade, some clinics thought they could expand their businesses in states that still allowed them to operate. It hasn’t quite worked out that way. Providing abortion services has always been a difficult business, with tiny-to-nonexistent profit margins and often-challenging logistical obstacles. And the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson two years ago, which eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, has made the landscape of reproductive services even tougher."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"He spent years stitching together shirts, trousers and relationships with the children he had once left behind. It all unraveled on a busy street in Los Angeles. He was usually there on early evenings, a gray-haired man with crinkles around his eyes trudging east along the cracked pavement of Adams Boulevard."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"Southwest Key, the Texas-based nonprofit that is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied minors who arrive at the southern border, has faced federal scrutiny before. The Justice Department has sued Southwest Key Programs, the nation’s largest operator of shelters for unaccompanied migrant children, accusing its employees of repeatedly subjecting minors in its care to sexual abuse and harassment."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"Seven million pounds of Boar’s Head meats have been recalled since late July, when reports of serious illnesses and deaths began to emerge.

New Mexico,2024,Q3,"Every spring, hundreds of bicyclists gather in Santa Fe, N.M., to ride through a high-desert landscape rich in art, history and Indigenous culture. This year, the author, who lost the use of his legs 12 years ago, joined them. The nervous energy was palpable as hundreds of bike riders, shrink-wrapped in colorful Lycra outfits, waited for the start of the 50-mile Half-Century ride from the Santa Fe Railyard, a center for art galleries, restaurants and a weekly farmers’ market in Santa Fe, N.M. Then, at last, we were winding through town as eight police officers on motorcycles leapfrogged ahead to guard the intersections."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"Eau Claire had a plan. But opponents, mostly from rural areas, were convinced that the newcomers would destroy their Midwestern way of life. The billboards featured a foreboding message. Taxpayer money, it said, was footing the bill for a nonprofit to traffic Somali refugees — and officials in Eau Claire, Wis., had been hiding the facts for months."
New Mexico,2024,Q3,"At least 171 people have been sickened in an outbreak linked to Raw Farm milk. Experts say that number could be far higher. When Jackie’s 9-year-old son came down with a low-grade fever in October, she chalked it up to a typical back-to-school bug. But his illness worsened over the next couple of days. “His skin tone looked gray,” she said, and near-constant diarrhea left him unable to sleep and too weak to stand."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"Lobbyists are trying to connect executives with the Trump transition team, and some familiar names are in the mix for top jobs. Before markets opened on Wednesday, Wall Street was scrambling to figure out what Donald Trump’s commanding win meant for business, including whom he would appoint and what they might do."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"The incoming president has promised the largest deportation effort in U.S. history.

This Sunday was the day that Daniel García, a Venezuelan delivery worker living in the capital of Colombia, had planned to begin an arduous land journey toward the United States."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"Nearly 50 people have become ill and one person has died, amid infections that may have been caused by slivered onions, the C.D.C. reported. One person has died and 49 people have become ill following an E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"The Los Angeles Dodgers star won the Rookie of the Year and Cy Young Awards in 1981, when “Fernandomania” made him a household name and filled ballparks. Fernando Valenzuela, the Mexican-born left-handed Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher who enthralled baseball fans as a 20-year-old in the 1981 season with a quirky windup that produced his signature screwball, died on Tuesday in Los Angeles. He was 63."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"A new state law allows tribes to file suit against gambling venues they don’t operate, potentially shuttering them and jeopardizing local tax revenue. In the sprawl of Los Angeles County, a handful of casinos have operated for decades."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,Voters across party lines shifted to the right on immigration. They blamed Biden-Harris for failing to control the chaotic border. Emily Schaefer supports mass deportations. She wants less immigration. And she opposes a path to citizenship for undocumented people who have been living in the United States for decades.
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"Health officials say that recalls of onions — the suspected source of the contamination — would help lessen the risk to consumers. Other major fast-food chains have also stopped offering onions. The number of people hospitalized from the E. coli outbreak linked to raw onions on McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers has more than doubled, and those reporting they have been sickened rose to 75, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"In the former president’s pitch to voters, historians hear echoes of the nation’s inescapable xenophobic history. Former President Donald J. Trump’s third run for the White House has neared its end the same way his first one started: with relentless dehumanizing portrayals of immigrants."
New Mexico,2024,Q4,"Pope Francis’s down-to-earth style has become a trademark of his papacy. New rules for papal burials are another step to seal it into his legacy.

Representative Yadira Caraveo, Democrat of Colorado, lost her first re-election battle to her Republican challenger, Gabe Evans, a state representative, former Army captain and police officer with ties to the far right, The Associated Press declared on Tuesday, handing the G.O.P. a key pickup as it closes in on retaining its House majority."
New York,2020,Q1,"Tracking entire populations to combat the pandemic now could open the doors to more invasive forms of government snooping later.

New York,2020,Q1,"The fragile, low-paying existence of home health aides at the epicenter of the pandemic.

New York,2020,Q1,The symptoms have been easy to deal with. The health care system has not. Almost a dozen calls with five health care providers over five hours. Two hours of hold music. Two hours in a hospital. Four days of anxiously checking an online portal for results. And lots of confusion.
New York,2020,Q1,"In New Rochelle, the early epicenter of the coronavirus in New York, the state’s first drive-in facility serves those at risk or with symptoms. NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. — Any other place, any other time, the three white tents set against the Long Island Sound in the middle of a public park, with a line of vehicles waiting to get in, could have easily been the scene of a wedding or a garden party."
New York,2020,Q1,"The fast-spreading virus has put an end to movies, date nights and other economic activity, prompting some economists to call a U.S. recession. In some places, public officials and private business owners moved with stunning speed. In others, paralyzing hesitancy, defiant bravado or blithe disregard dominated. But by Monday, it was clear everywhere that most of the American economy was grinding to an unparalleled halt and would remain that way for months."
New York,2020,Q1,"“It’s been very crazy,” said one of the thousands of New Yorkers under quarantine about the official guidance she has gotten. For two women who had learned just the day before that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, the call on Saturday from the New York City Health Department offered some implausibly good news."
New York,2020,Q1,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo pushed to raise the minimum wage, which helped low-income workers, but it has also increased New York’s Medicaid costs. ALBANY, N.Y. — In the curious case of New York State’s $6 billion budget gap, Gov. Andrew M.

New York,2020,Q2,"Not having an accurate, honest, nationwide way to tally Covid-19 cases will only add to the current tragedy. We recently received the death certificate for my mother, who died May 4 in an assisted-living facility near New York City. “Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome” was the primary cause. And the secondary — no surprise — was “suspected Covid-19.”"
New York,2020,Q2,"A sharp drop in coronavirus patients was “like someone turned off the hose,” one doctor said. But the city’s health system faces challenges ahead. Across New York City, hospitals have moved into a new phase in their battle against the coronavirus."
New York,2020,Q2,"Dr. Oxiris Barbot re-emerged and said she’s on the team. But one of her agency’s key functions in managing the pandemic has been handed to another city department. For nearly a week, New York City’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, had mysteriously vanished from public view."
New York,2020,Q2,"Race and income are the key factors that decide who dies from Covid-19 and who survives, city data shows. New data released Monday sheds light on one of the biggest questions about the toll the coronavirus has taken on New York: Where are people dying?"
New York,2020,Q2,"The head of New York City’s public hospitals pushed to keep the city open in early March. Now the mayor has put him in charge of contact tracing, deepening a rift with the Health Department. As Mayor Bill de Blasio was resisting calls in March to cancel large gatherings and slow the spread of the coronavirus in New York City, he found behind-the-scenes support from a trusted voice: the head of his public hospital system, Dr. Mitchell Katz."
New York,2020,Q2,"Yaakov Shereshevsky has been saying the Viduy, a Jewish prayer, for terminal Covid patients. “No one is meant to see so much death that quickly,” said Yaakov Shereshevsky, an I.C.U. nurse at N.Y.U. Langone Health, where the coronavirus outbreak has taken a heavy toll. For a while, he said, eight floors — 34 beds on each floor — were devoted to Covid-19 patients, and they were at capacity. “At one point, we had 20- and 30-year-olds dying,” he said. “It was a horrible, brutal, helpless feeling. It felt like there was no light. Now it’s getting better.”"
New York,2020,Q2,"Mayor de Blasio should let the health department do its Covid-19 tracing. Much is uncertain about New York City’s future amid coronavirus — the timeline for reopening, the timeline for development of treatments and a vaccine. But one thing has remained clear: In order to safely reopen, cities like New York must develop the capacity to regularly test portions of the population, trace the spread of the virus and isolate those who have been exposed. And as the count of those struggling both in health and finances continues to mount, time is of the essence. New York needs contact tracing quickly."

Cuomo said on Saturday, an alarming rise in a phenomenon that was first publicly identified earlier this week."
New York,2020,Q2,"Leading health officials expressed serious concerns over the transfer of contact tracing to the agency that runs public hospitals, a departure from current and past practice.

New York,2020,Q3,"The sustained low rate of infection has surprised local health officials. But a resurgence may be inevitable, despite the state’s and city’s best efforts.

Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday."
New York,2020,Q3,"In March and April, death rates rivaled those seen during the country’s deadliest pandemic, a new study finds. “What 1918 looked like is basically this.” The 1918 influenza pandemic is the deadliest in modern history, claiming an estimated 50 million lives worldwide, including 675,000 in the United States."
New York,2020,Q3,"Transmission, even in New York City, is well below thresholds experts say are safe, but issues like adequate ventilation to combat aerosol spread of the virus remain.

Andrew M. Cuomo gave districts permission to do so."

New York,2020,Q4,"Survival rates have improved with medical advances and less crowded hospitals, studies say. But the latest record-breaking surge in infections could reverse the gains. The coronavirus struck the United States earlier this year with devastating force. In April, it killed more than 10,000 people in New York City. By early May, nearly 50,000 nursing home residents and their caregivers across the country had died."
New York,2020,Q4,"They came to work when death counts were horrific and the risks enormous. Now they fear for their jobs. At one home, they agreed to speak out.

Employees in sanitary gowns and face masks moved through a brightly decorated front area devoid of residents or chatter."
New York,2020,Q4,Government officials warned that hackers were seeking to hold American hospitals’ data hostage in exchange for ransom payments.

New York,2020,Q4,"City gyms were allowed to reopen on Sept. 2, but lingering concerns about indoor workouts mean many may not endure. The coronavirus has made a routine trip to the gym feel like a health threat."
New York,2020,Q4,"Regulators say a major group is misrepresenting cost-sharing plans, saddling people with unpaid medical bills. New York State accused a major Christian group on Tuesday of deceiving customers by illegally offering health insurance to as many as 40,000 residents since 2016."
New York,2020,Q4,"Even as Mayor Bill de Blasio has emptied out the city’s jails, the number of people who are placed in punitive segregation each year has remained about the same.

New York,2020,Q4,"New York City had been holding off a second wave, but an uptick in cases in Brooklyn and Queens now threatens to bring one on.

New York,2020,Q4,"Rochester officers followed their training in restraining Mr. Prude, who was incoherent, but did little to calm him down or defuse his anger. ROCHESTER, N.Y. — One officer wrote in his arrest report that he knew that Daniel Prude had been “previously suicidal” before his disastrous encounter with police and had spent hours a day earlier in a psychiatric ward."

New York is facing the biggest threat of a coronavirus resurgence since the pandemic devastated the city last spring, sparking fears that an anticipated second wave of infections has begun."
New York,2020,Q4,"Half of New York’s students should be tested every two weeks, researchers estimate. Officials plan to test only 10 to 20 percent of each school every month. New York City’s ambitious plan to randomly test students for coronavirus in each of its 1,800 public schools will likely be insufficient to catch outbreaks before they spread beyond a handful of students, according to new estimates of the spread of infections in city schools."
New York,2021,Q1,"The intervention was the earliest action yet known in an effort by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that concealed how many nursing home residents died in the pandemic. Top aides to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo were alarmed: A report written by state health officials had just landed, and it included a count of how many nursing home residents in New York had died in the pandemic."
New York,2021,Q1,"The rampage on the A train line reflected a convergence of crises — homelessness and mental illness — in a desolate subway system. By the time Rigoberto Lopez boarded an A train on a recent Friday, he was years into a downward spiral. He had hit his father. He had punched a police officer. He had been caught with cocaine that the police said he intended to sell."
New York,2021,Q1,"As we listlessly hoist our home dumbbells, let’s take a deep breath and reflect on a lost epicenter of New York City fitness culture. One afternoon in 1987, while working as a trainer at a Jack LaLanne gym near Plainfield, N.J., Terri Walsh received an invitation to interview at the chain’s most exclusive club, a renovated parking garage on 61st Street where well-heeled Upper East Siders traded stiletto pumps for Reebok sneakers.

Through a pair of glass doors below a brick archway, she “walked right into the heart of everything,” she said."

ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov. Andrew M.

New York,2021,Q1,"The rate in January was far below the 10 percent recommended by some experts. Now, officials are aiming to put a more robust program in place.

New York,2021,Q1,"“When I say ‘experts’ in air quotes, it sounds like I’m saying I don’t really trust the experts,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said of pandemic policies. “Because I don’t.” The deputy commissioner for public health at the New York State Health Department resigned in late summer. Soon after, the director of its bureau of communicable disease control also stepped down. So did the medical director for epidemiology. Last month, the state epidemiologist said she, too, would be leaving."
New York,2021,Q1,"The state attorney general, Letitia James, said it’s likely that the Cuomo administration failed to report thousands of Covid-19 deaths of nursing home residents.

New York,2021,Q1,"Virus cases are surging among incarcerated people at prisons and jails. But state officials have not announced when they will be vaccinated.

New York,2021,Q2,"The technology company Kinsa will distribute as many as 100,000 internet-connected thermometers through the city’s elementary schools. Over the past few years, a California-based tech start-up has repeatedly made headlines for beating public health agencies at their own game."
New York,2021,Q2,"As the coronavirus tore through New York, a group of medical students graduated early to help the hospitals under siege and found courage they didn’t know they had. Iris had been a doctor for all of six days. Her long white coat still felt almost like a costume. Her patient had a severe case of Covid-19. She wanted to put him on the phone with his family, but first she had to ask him the essential question: Did he know how he wanted to die?"
New York,2021,Q2,"The health system, which is preparing to open a new laboratory that could process 100,000 tests a day, wants to take its program to public schools this fall. Every week, students at KIPP Infinity Middle School, in West Harlem, file into a large auditorium and take their places on the designated floor markings, making sure to stand six feet apart. Then they pull down their masks and fill sterile tubes with their spit."
New York,2021,Q2,"The state will offer free subway and rail tickets as an incentive, joining a broader nationwide push to speed up the flagging pace of vaccinations. Officials in New York are trying to boost a flagging vaccination campaign by setting up temporary walk-in vaccination sites at eight subway and train stations this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday."
New York,2021,Q2,"For the most fragile New Yorkers and those who care for them, turning 23 brings enormous consequences. With one ear on the sound monitor linked to his daughter’s room, Joe Trimarchi sat at his dining room table in the Rosebank section of Staten Island. He was stuffing dozens of envelopes, hoping that one of them would land on the desk of a politician who might care. Mr. Trimarchi, 55, is a cashier in the billing department of Staten Island University Hospital, but what animates him is advocating for his daughter Alexia."
New York,2021,Q2,"Working on the audio documentary “Odessa” gave one producer a painful look at the post-lockdown emotional struggles of teenagers. Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together."
New York,2021,Q2,"Aides to the New York governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, repeatedly prevented state health officials from releasing the number of nursing home deaths in the pandemic. The effort by Gov.

The same thing had happened the day before."

New York,2021,Q3,"The new city policy takes aim at improving vaccination rates at public hospitals. Around 60 percent of workers in the city’s public hospital system are vaccinated.

New York,2022,Q3,"As New York City and the federal government strain to supply enough vaccines, patients face a private battle to find treatment and relief from serious symptoms.

New York,2022,Q4,"More people with severe mental illness may soon arrive in New York City’s emergency rooms. What happens to them next? The most famous homeless person in New York in 1987 went by the name Billie Boggs.

She was observed barefoot in winter and sometimes twirled an umbrella to keep people at a distance."

New York,2022,Q4,"For Trump, Pelosi, Biden and Musk, not everything is going according to plan. Gail Collins: Bret, before we get to politics, let’s talk about the terrible shooting at the gay club in Colorado Springs on Saturday night. To me, it speaks to both gay rights and gun violence. We’ve been making certain progress on the first, not really on the second. And if you want to tie in the mass shooting at the University of Virginia and the terrible stabbings in Idaho — Lord, what do you say?"
New York,2022,Q4,"The New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams, found that the number of mental health crisis centers and mobile response teams has fallen since 2019.

New York,2023,Q1,"My sister lost her job, her home, her life as she’d known it. And it could have been even worse.  A few weeks before Mayor Eric Adams announced that New York would begin a big push to involuntarily hospitalize severely mentally ill homeless people even if they posed no risk of harm to others, my sister was involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric unit in a city hospital.

New York,2023,Q2,"It was all so calm and unhurried. Sometimes, somehow, the fear of violence shakes people more than violence itself. At the opening of the video, the audio is strangely muffled. Juan Alberto Vázquez, the freelance journalist who captured the footage, begins recording from outside the train car where Daniel Penny has a 30-year-old homeless man named Jordan Neely in a chokehold. A couple of other passengers help restrain Neely, making sure he cannot wrestle free. Neely opens his mouth, but all we can hear is people chattering over the electric whir of machinery, the sounds of shoes squeaking on the station’s floors, the squeal of other trains arriving and taking their leave — all the engulfing, familiar white noise of a New York subway station.

New York,2023,Q2,Jordan Neely’s death has renewed debate over the New York City mayor’s strategy of flooding platforms with police officers to improve safety.

According to the police, witnesses described him as “hostile and erratic,” and some claimed he was throwing trash. “I don’t have food, I don’t have a drink, I’m fed up. I don’t mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I’m ready to die,” he reportedly shouted."
New York,2023,Q2,"Jordan Neely’s mental health decline played out in public after his mother was strangled. Daniel Penny said he was protecting himself and others when he choked Mr. Neely.

He was a regular on the subway, once a gifted Michael Jackson impersonator, but he was also troubled. City workers had tried to help him for years."
New York,2023,Q2,Subway cars should not be homes — or deathbeds. You may notice that my Now Reading links this week all have to do with homelessness. I made that choice apropos of the killing of Jordan Neely in a subway car in Manhattan on Monday.

The older of the two sisters, Minnie Lee, stares hard at the camera, her gaze direct and unsmiling but pleasant, almost quizzical. Her hair is freshly pressed, hot-curled and brushed into place, making her look older than 14. In a clean white dress with lacy zigzags, she seems ready for Sunday school. Her left arm is draped around her baby sister, Mary Alice, age 12, anchoring her in place. The younger Relf sister cracks a big, playful smile, her hair in braids — and not the usual three unruly braids from other pictures of the sisters during this time. Instead they are pinned down, neat and tidy for the Ebony shoot. The bottom of Mary Alice’s schoolgirl dress is hiked up as she reaches up to rest her right arm, the one that’s not fully formed, a disability she was born with, on her sister’s shoulder."

Vidal’s parents, who lived with the two boys in a small house in steamy Cebu City in the Philippines, didn’t have the money to send his brother to special-education classes, so when Vidal came home from school each day, he would find his brother mumbling to himself in the living room.

Vidal went to nursing school and graduated second in his class, perhaps because he already had a decade of informal experience. When his mother died in 2020, Vidal’s father became his brother’s sole caretaker, leaving Vidal to be the wage-earner for the family. He needed to make more money. So last year, at 26, Vidal moved to America to work at a nursing home in Brooklyn. "

Ohio,2021,Q1,"The immediate winner of college football’s national championship was easy to discern by the crowds after the game. The health consequences are yet to be seen.

Ohio,2022,Q1,"Officials say demand has slowed as coronavirus cases have fallen. But some experts question the scaling back of services, especially vaccination campaigns. CHICAGO — As Americans shed masks and return to offices and restaurants, local and state officials are scaling back the most visible public health efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic."
Ohio,2022,Q1,"Early research suggests this age-old practice might benefit mental health, but more research is needed. In a TikTok video from January, self-help author Mel Robbins held a hammer in 12-degree weather in her backyard in Vermont. “We’re about to do the cold plunge,” she said to the camera, after breaking through a layer of ice on the surface of a barrel to expose the water below. She then climbed into the barrel and, taking a deep breath, sank into the water chest deep."

Ohio,2022,Q1,"Reports of infections are falling in Cleveland, Newark and Washington, suggesting that a national peak may be approaching. At another bleak moment of the pandemic in the United States — with nearly 800,000 new cases a day, deaths rising and federal medical teams deploying to overwhelmed hospitals — glints of progress have finally started to emerge.

Ohio,2022,Q1,"Intel announces plans for a $20 billion chip manufacturing complex in Ohio. With Omicron beginning a retreat, is a “new normal” coming? And the Fed meets, with inflation high on the agenda. Microsoft on Monday announced plans to buy the video game company Activision Blizzard for almost $70 billion, its biggest deal ever. The company said the acquisition would help it compete in the so-called Metaverse, the nascent virtual world where some technologists believe we’ll soon live second lives. But Microsoft’s more immediate objective is probably to strengthen its gaming platform. Just as Netflix acquires content to compete for streaming viewers’ attention and subscription fees, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision — the maker of popular games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush — may bolster the library of games for Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s $10-a-month Netflix-style video game subscription service. The size of the deal, and the possibility that Microsoft could make some popular Activision titles exclusive to its platform, could bring renewed antitrust scrutiny to the company from federal regulators."

Ohio,2022,Q3,"The photographer Stephanie Sinclair captured the newly unsettled world inside the Cleveland Clinic, where Ohio’s abortion laws have drastically changed maternal care. Pregnancy can be dangerous — occasionally fatal — for both women and the fetuses they hope to deliver. Fetal conditions, like a nonviable twin that threatens the health of its sibling, can also imperil the mother. So can disorders like cancer, heart disease, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and lupus. Even something as straightforward as age — becoming pregnant when younger than 17 or older than 35 — or carrying twins or having a history of multiple miscarriages can put women and pregnancies in jeopardy. That’s why so many obstetricians regard the ability to terminate a pregnancy as essential: Doctors need access to abortion procedures to be able to provide care and save lives."
Ohio,2022,Q3,"It’s terrifying to be a doctor in post-Roe America.  Earlier this week I was preparing to write a guest essay with my colleague Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an OB-GYN here in Indiana. We wanted to write about the chilling effect that the overturning of Roe v. Wade has had on medicine in our state and around the country in just a few short weeks. But then Dr. Bernard became a target of a national smear campaign for speaking out about her 10-year-old patient, a rape victim from Ohio who needed an abortion and had to travel to Indiana to receive one, given the restrictions in her home state."
Ohio,2022,Q3,"The Opinion podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro explored the future of reproductive health care in a virtual event. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, medical providers were faced with a complex patchwork of state-level abortion bans and prohibitions. In Arizona, medical workers wondered if a century-old law banning almost all abortions and punishing providers with prison time meant that they should stop the procedures. In Wisconsin, a district attorney said he would not prosecute abortion cases after an 1849 state law banning them took effect."
Ohio,2022,Q3,"An Ohio 10-year-old’s recent abortion has generated fierce debate. Doctors in countries where pregnancy is common in adolescents say the toll of childbirth on young bodies is brutal. After the account of a 10-year-old Ohio girl crossing state lines to get an abortion drew national attention last week, some prominent abortion opponents suggested the child should have carried her pregnancy to term."
Ohio,2022,Q3,"A document obtained by The New York Times shows that the Indiana obstetrician reported the child’s abortion to the state. A lawyer for the Indiana obstetrician who has drawn national attention for providing abortion care to a 10-year-old rape victim said on Thursday that the doctor had taken “every appropriate and proper action” in the case — including filing necessary forms to report the abortion with state authorities, contrary to the assertions of Indiana’s attorney general."
Ohio,2022,Q3,"One 10-year-old became the focus of debate, but more than 1,000 girls under 15 seek abortions each year. “How are we going to help the pregnant kids?” She was just 10 years old, so young that many people were horrified when they heard it, and others refused to believe it. But the ordeal of the child rape victim in Ohio who had to cross state lines for an abortion, and the ugly political fight that followed, have highlighted two uncomfortable facts: Such pregnancies are not as rare as people think, and new abortion bans are likely to have a pronounced impact on the youngest pregnant girls."

LAKEWOOD, Ohio — If you’re building an entertainment center in sports-crazy Northeast Ohio, it makes sense to go heavy on athletics.

Ohio,2022,Q4,"A new motion argues that lifting the Covid-19 policy next month will open the door to a surge of migrants in their states. Fifteen states have intervened to try to keep in place a pandemic-related policy that allows the government to swiftly expel migrants arriving from Mexico, a prelude to Republican plans to push new security measures on the southern border."
Ohio,2022,Q4,"The dual agreements would resolve thousands of lawsuits over the retailers’ role in the addiction crisis. But a large majority of state, local and tribal governments must sign on. CVS and Walgreens, two of the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chains, said on Wednesday that they had reached tentative agreements to pay about $5 billion each to settle thousands of lawsuits over their role in the opioid crisis, a development that could signal the beginning of the end of years of opioid litigation."

New York Times photographers talked to men and women across the country about the issues that mattered to them."
Ohio,2022,Q4,"Race has been as big a part of the story as partisanship. Year three of the Covid-19 pandemic is now more than halfway over, believe it or not — with a fall surge likely on the way. But the emergency phase is far enough in the country’s rearview mirror that the experience of the pandemic thus far can be examined a little more clinically and a little less ideologically. Increasingly, it feels possible to take stock not just of what happened but also of the inadequacy of some of the stories we told ourselves to make sense of the mess."
Ohio,2022,Q4,"Abortion rights and antidemocratic stances were more relevant or pressing in some places than others. The results of this year’s midterm elections won’t be final for weeks, but there’s more than enough data to say this: They were very different from usual."
Ohio,2022,Q4,"For ordinary workers living paycheck to paycheck, the G.O.P. is AWOL. J.D. Vance, the Ohio Republican Senate candidate, states on his campaign website that he “fiercely defended working-class Americans.” In Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican Senate hopeful, sports a plaid shirt and jeans in a campaign ad, as he shoots guns of varying sizes.

Nothing could make those early pandemic days easier for me and my colleagues, but those haphazard symphonies of appreciation helped keep us going.

On what has become a solemn date in Tulsa, a group of Black leaders met with Mayor G.T. Bynum on the first of June. It was the 99th anniversary of one of the deadliest race riots in American history, when a Black neighborhood in the city was destroyed by a white mob in 1921."
Oklahoma,2020,Q3,"His publicly dismissive attitude about the pandemic reflected the hands-off inconsistency of many party leaders. The death of Herman Cain, attributed to the coronavirus, has made Republicans and President Trump face the reality of the pandemic as it hit closer to home than ever before, claiming a prominent conservative ally whose frequently dismissive attitude about taking the threat seriously reflected the hands-off inconsistency of party leaders."
Oklahoma,2020,Q4,"Multiple positive or inconclusive coronavirus tests, and a health protocol breach, left the Houston Rockets with too few players to compete in their season opener Wednesday. In an immediate blow to the N.B.A.’s attempt to stage a season without the protection of a restricted-access bubble, league officials were forced to postpone the Houston Rockets’ season opener on Wednesday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder when the Rockets were unable to field the required minimum of eight players in uniform."

Oklahoma,2020,Q4,"A burst of production solved the dire shortage that defined the first wave of the coronavirus. But the surplus may not be enough to prevent large numbers of deaths. As record numbers of coronavirus cases overwhelm hospitals across the United States, there is something strikingly different from the surge that inundated cities in the spring: No one is clamoring for ventilators."
Oklahoma,2021,Q1,Medical professionals questioned how well the individual plastic bubbles protected band members and concertgoers from the coronavirus. There are Covid-19 bubbles — small clusters of friends or family who agree to socialize exclusively with each other during the pandemic — and then there are the kinds of bubbles the Flaming Lips used at recent concerts.

Oklahoma,2021,Q1,"The Trump administration instructed states to begin vaccinating a wider group of Americans. In an attempt to speed up the sluggish pace of the U.S. vaccination campaign, the Trump administration changed course today and instructed states to immediately begin vaccinating Americans over 65, as well as adults with conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus."
Oklahoma,2021,Q1,The tribe’s Supreme Court excised language from its constitution that limited the citizenship rights of descendants of Black people who had been enslaved by the tribe before the Civil War.

Oklahoma,2021,Q1,"Hospitals use century-old lien laws to bypass insurers and charge patients, especially poorer ones, the full amount. When Monica Smith was badly hurt in a car accident, she assumed Medicaid would cover the medical bills. Ms. Smith, 45, made sure to show her insurance card after an ambulance took her to Parkview Regional Medical Center in Fort Wayne, Ind. She spent three days in the hospital and weeks in a neck brace."

Oklahoma,2021,Q2,"Some experts insist it’s more important to track the time we’ve lost to the pandemic rather than the lives. Anna Carter would be 14 if she were alive today. She would be finishing eighth grade and growing her savings account by babysitting for neighborhood kids. In a year, she would have started high school; in two, she would have been old enough to test for her driver’s license. That’s where her future starts to blur — after all, two years is a long time for a teenager."
Oklahoma,2021,Q2,"Cases are surging. We need to maximize the number of inoculated frontline workers and students. The next coronavirus surge seems to be underway. Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin are among the states with rising cases, hospitalizations and intensive care occupancy, and hospitalization rates among younger people are increasing nationally. The causes of this pronounced rush of cases — the spread of a more infectious B.1.1.7 variant and lockdown fatigue — are not going away."

Oklahoma,2021,Q2,"The Labor Department still (still!) needs to do more to protect employees from getting Covid on the job. Since foiling Donald Trump’s bid for a second term, Joe Biden has gone out of his way to send working-class voters the message that he, and not his predecessor, is the true champion of their interests. Shortly after he was inaugurated, Mr. Biden signed an executive order to encourage the federal government and federal contractors to pay their workers a $15 minimum hourly wage. He fired the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, an anti-union lawyer and a Trump appointee. In a video tweeted in late February, Mr. Biden paid homage to unions and warned employers that there should be “no intimidation, no coercion, no threats” when workers exercise their collective bargaining rights."

Oklahoma,2021,Q2,"In recent weeks and months, as people have ventured out more often, business has jumped for companies that sell plans to help lose weight. Maybe it was the frozen pizza. Or the cheesy snack crackers she mindlessly nibbled on as she worked from home over the past year. Or those darn cookies."
Oklahoma,2021,Q2,"The United States has a dark history of court-sanctioned sterilization, but more recent rulings and legislation suggest it would violate a basic right. Among the stunning assertions that the pop star Britney Spears made to a Los Angeles probate judge this week, as she sought to end her protracted conservatorship, was one that shook experts in guardianship law and reproductive rights deeply. She said a team led by her father, who is her conservator, prevented her from having her IUD removed because the team did not want her to have more children."

Oklahoma,2021,Q3,"The vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness and death, but they are not a golden shield against the coronavirus. A wedding in Oklahoma leads to 15 vaccinated guests becoming infected with the coronavirus. Raucous Fourth of July celebrations disperse the virus from Provincetown, Mass., to dozens of places across the country, sometimes carried by fully vaccinated celebrants."
Oklahoma,2021,Q3,"The deaths, spread out across four states in January 2020, have become part of a scattershot collection of clues about the virus’s early spread. Late last year, the federal government’s chief statistician on death received word about a tantalizing discovery: Someone had died from Covid-19 in January 2020, a death certificate said, a revelation that would have sped up the timeline of the virus’s spread in the United States by several weeks."
Oklahoma,2021,Q3,"Covid made things worse for many people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. But it also came with a silver lining. Most people behave in one or more ways that others may consider peculiar, and I am no exception. I want my clothes to match, from shoes to eyeglasses and everything in between (including underwear — a challenge when packing for a trip). If visitors use my kitchen, they’re asked to put things back exactly where they were found. In arranging my furniture, countertops and wall-hangings, I strive for symmetry. And I label packaged foods with their expiration dates and place them in my pantry in date order."

Oklahoma,2021,Q3,"Looking for love demands a little more discernment in the age of Covid. Since November 2020, Kerry Kijewski has been waiting to connect in person with a man she met online during the winter lockdown. Despite the fact that he lives only 40 minutes from her home in London, Ontario, their dating relationship has been entirely virtual."
Oklahoma,2021,Q3,"President Biden’s policies helped shut down a camp in Mexico that housed migrants during the Trump administration. But thousands are gathered now in a new camp. “The border is not really any different,” said a lawyer working there. REYNOSA, Mexico — For nearly three years under the Trump administration, a makeshift camp of migrants from all over the world operated in the Mexican city of Matamoros. It was effectively the first refugee camp on the U.S.-Mexico border, packed with people hoping to win asylum in the United States but forced to wait in Mexico while their cases were being considered."

Oklahoma,2021,Q4,"From broadband to transportation to high-tech medical manufacturing, benefits from America’s pandemic money infusion will linger. Covid-19 put American infrastructure to the test — and by most measures, it failed, exposing the unstable, outdated systems that uphold our lives. Students without access to the internet tried to get by on once-a-week printed packets. Nurses wore trash bags as medical equipment. Nobody could buy toilet paper. But these failures, along with so many more, may also have provided the impetus — in the form of unprecedented federal funding — for the United States to modernize itself, filling cracks and bridging gaps in our technological, medical and manufacturing capabilities that have been widening for decades."
Oklahoma,2021,Q4,"For Indigenous people, the dish is both a family comfort food and a relic of colonial displacement. Art Coulson, a Cherokee writer who lives in Minneapolis, took a deep breath before he tried to define Native American fry bread."

Oklahoma,2021,Q4,"A Texas statute that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy was seemingly undercut by two court rulings, but the reality on the ground has not changed. HOUSTON — Within the span of a few hours, a Texas judge and the U.S. Supreme Court appeared to undercut Texas’ six-week abortion ban, ruling in separate opinions late Thursday and early Friday that aspects of the law were unconstitutional under state law and that federal challenges could go forward."
Oklahoma,2021,Q4,"A case before the Supreme Court is seen as potentially pivotal in establishing how aggressively the justices might move to place new constraints on abortion rights. In December, the Supreme Court heard arguments on a Mississippi law that is a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, setting the stage for what could be the most consequential abortion rights ruling in decades."
Oklahoma,2021,Q4,"The 135-year-old company announced plans to divide itself into a consumer products business and a medical company. For generations, Johnson & Johnson has been synonymous with American health care — and, at times, with American health care scandals."
Oklahoma,2021,Q4,"A police bulletin seeking information on a man recorded shoplifting packages of diapers drew fresh attention to a continuing crisis of access to the product, according to the National Diaper Bank Network. “Anyone recognize him?” the police in Winter Haven, Fla., asked on Facebook last month."

Oklahoma,2022,Q1,The first checks could be cut in April. The money — from the nation’s three major pharmaceutical distributors and Johnson & Johnson — will be used for addiction treatment and prevention. The nation’s three largest drug distributors and a major pharmaceutical manufacturer announced Friday that a supermajority of states and localities had accepted the terms of their $26 billion offer to settle thousands of civil claims related to the deadly opioid crisis.

Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"A 1,000-mile journey through the middle of America reveals the fundamental reason for truck driver shortages: It is a job full of stress, physical deprivation and loneliness. A faint winter sun slides toward the frozen scrub as Stephen Graves guides his tractor-trailer across the cracked pavement of a truck stop parking lot in southern Oklahoma. Exhausted from another 400 miles behind the wheel, he needs the restroom. But mostly he needs an answer to the same question that dogs him nearly every day as darkness falls: Where can he park his rig for the night?"
Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"The pandemic has changed children. Some can’t shake that feeling of instability. Others are taking on adult responsibilities. And anxiety is all around. After months of remote learning, a year of in-person-but-not-quite-stable hybrid school and a fall semester that was just beginning to feel kind of normal, Kyla Chester-Hopkins, a high school junior in Milwaukee, learned that she had Covid-19."
Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"In anticipation of the court’s decision, a frenzy of legislative activity to shut down access to abortion forms a picture of a post-Roe America. Both sides of the abortion debate anticipate that come July, the Supreme Court will have overturned Roe v. Wade and with it the constitutional right to abortion, handing anti-abortion activists a victory they have sought for five decades. But from Florida to Idaho, Republican-led state legislatures are not waiting: They are operating as if Roe has already been struck down, advancing new restrictions that aim to make abortion illegal in as many circumstances as possible."
Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"For the past two years, Americans have accepted more harm to children in exchange for less harm to adults. American children are starting 2022 in crisis."
Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"Yes, but they haven’t made a big difference. Daily life in red and blue America has continued to be quite different over the past few months. It’s a reflection of the partisan divide over Covid-19. Consider:"
Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"Pharmacists and technicians, who have played a critical role in administering Covid-19 tests and vaccines, say they are burned out nearly two years into the pandemic. WASHINGTON — Ken O’Shea spent eight years working in retail pharmacies, first as a technician and then as a pharmacist. He liked working on the front lines and seeing his patients get better over time."
Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"Recent huddles among the sport’s leaders have shown how much television drives their thinking. INDIANAPOLIS — Freezing rain had turned the downtown sidewalks here into granite-hard slip-and-slide tracks. A downtown concert stage and beer garden sat vacant, a dance and light drone show was canceled, and getting a restaurant table — even a socially distant one — was no problem at all on Saturday night."
Oklahoma,2022,Q1,"In Maryland, Florida and other states, Republican governors have been attacking the national economy while boasting about the one in their states. Economists say it defies logic. In speeches and media appearances, Republican governors are savaging President Biden for policies they say are wrecking the U.S. economy as a whole. But in the particulars — in their own states, in other words — the economy’s booming."

Oklahoma,2022,Q2,"The killing of four people at a medical building in Tulsa, Okla., added to a relentless toll of recent mass violence in the United States. Since the devastating attack on an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last week, mass shootings around the country have been relentless, coming at a pace of more than two a day."
Oklahoma,2022,Q2,"Psychiatrists were once arbiters of abortion access. Will they resume that role post-Roe? If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, will psychiatrists resume their pre-Roe role as arbiters of abortion access? The law once compelled psychiatrists and pregnant women to perform dishonest rituals to get abortions. Will psychiatrists once again need to be complicit post-Roe?"
Oklahoma,2022,Q2,Sales of the emergency contraceptive surged after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.  
Oklahoma,2022,Q2,"To adequately address violence, we need to take stock of everything at once. What might have stopped the gunman from killing 21 people in Uvalde, Texas? In the aftermath of the shootings, familiar details emerged. We know he fought with his mother. We know he has been accused of posting footage of himself seriously abusing one or more cats online. We know he shot his grandmother, who worked at Robb Elementary. We know he harassed girls on social media and when one of those girls reported him to a social media app, nothing was done. And most critically, we know he bought a weapon of war around his 18th birthday from a company that offered buy-now-pay-later-style financing. The process for buying the gun was little more onerous than that for purchasing Sudafed."
Oklahoma,2022,Q2,"If the Supreme Court were to end Roe v. Wade, about half of states would be expected to ban abortion quickly or limit it heavily. If the Supreme Court were to end Roe v. Wade, about half of states would be expected to ban abortion quickly or limit it heavily."
Oklahoma,2022,Q2,"The food of the Zomi people of Myanmar isn’t easy to find in America, even in this city so welcoming to refugees. But this weekend it will move front and center. TULSA, Okla. — The electrifying flavors of bawngsa kan — beef fried with generous amounts of tamarind, ginger and chiles — are easy to love. But finding the dish in an American restaurant is a challenge."
Oklahoma,2022,Q2,"The spread of the subvariants adds more uncertainty to the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States. The Omicron subvariants known as BA.4 and BA.5 now represent 13 percent of new coronavirus cases in the United States, up from 7.5 percent a week ago and 1 percent in early May, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"They tend to have the weakest social services and the worst results in several categories of health and well-being. In Mississippi, which brought the abortion case that ended Roe v.

Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"Of the 13 states with trigger bans, all make exceptions for abortions to save the life of the mother. But what defines a medical emergency? HOUSTON — Dr. Amanda Horton, an obstetrician who specializes in high-risk pregnancies, had been counseling pregnant patients at a small hospital in rural Texas last month when a woman arrived in crisis: It was only 17 weeks into her pregnancy and her water had broken."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"David Siau and his 18-month-old daughter, McKenzie, were killed when Derick Amos Madden rammed his vehicle into the family in East Glacier Park, Mont., and shot at them, the authorities said. A man struck a family with his vehicle as they were walking beside a roadway near Glacier National Park in Montana on Sunday and then fired at them with a shotgun, killing a man and his 18-month-old daughter, the authorities said."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"Corporal punishment had been in a slow decline before the pandemic, but remains legal in 19 states, mostly in the South. The practice makes children more aggressive and disruptive, researchers say. A Missouri school district’s announcement that it is bringing back paddling drew a lot of attention and dismay this week. But corporal punishment — with an interruption, perhaps, for the coronavirus pandemic in some places — never went away in a large number of schools."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"The directors Paula Eiselt and Tonya Lewis Lee discuss their journey in making the documentary “Aftershock,” which shines a light on a national health crisis. “Black lives matter because Black wombs matter!” Shawnee Benton Gibson chanted from the stage during a National Action Network rally in Washington, D.C., in 2020."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"Information and medications needed to end a pregnancy are increasingly available outside the health care system. In states that have banned abortion, some women with unwanted pregnancies are pursuing an unconventional workaround: They are “self-managing” their abortions, seeking out the necessary know-how online and obtaining the medications without the supervision of a clinic or a doctor."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"Federal officials are not relying on an established system to distribute the vaccine, slowing immunizations and burdening local health departments, critics say. Roughly 5,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine intended for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., left the national stockpile’s warehouse in Olive Branch, Miss., on July 19. They somehow ended up in Oklahoma."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"Often described as ground zero for the epidemic, the communities of Cabell County and Huntington, W. Va., had opted out of a settlement and lost their case at trial. A federal judge has ruled that the nation’s three largest drug distributors cannot be held liable for the opioid epidemic in one of the most ravaged counties in the country — a place where 81 million prescription painkillers were shipped over eight years to a population of less than 100,000."
Oklahoma,2022,Q3,"Major data gaps, the result of decades of underinvestment in public health, have undercut the government response to the coronavirus and now to monkeypox. ANCHORAGE — After a middle-aged woman tested positive for Covid-19 in January at her workplace in Fairbanks, public health workers sought answers to questions vital to understanding how the virus was spreading in Alaska’s rugged interior."

Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"Aching from a string of farmer suicides and other mental health challenges, neighbors in rural eastern Colorado are learning how to check in on one another. But as the drought drags on, is talking enough? LA JUNTA, Colo. — Before Freud and before the pharmaceutical industry came to define what we understand as mental illness, doctors used to prescribe wealthy men suffering nervous breakdowns “the West Cure.” Building on the theories of George Miller Beard, who blamed modern life for frayed nerves, they recommended elites like Teddy Roosevelt trade reading their newspapers for a regimen of riding and roping beneath the cavernous skies. More than a century later, modern life has only gotten faster, and from Bozeman, Mont., to Denver, the West remains a popular place to retreat from it all. But the West Cure was never meant for the people who actually live there."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"Ten years after the Supreme Court ruled that states did not have to expand Medicaid, the politics are changing in states like South Dakota, where rural hospitals and nursing homes are struggling. CONDE, S.D. — Progressives have helped bring health coverage to tens of thousands of uninsured Americans with an exercise in direct democracy: They have persuaded voters to pass ballot measures expanding Medicaid in six states where Republican elected officials had long been standing in the way."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"The loss raises questions about whether a national wave of unionization may be slowing. A union had won two previous votes at the grocery chain. Workers at a Trader Joe’s store in Brooklyn have voted against unionizing, handing a union its first loss at the company after two victories this year."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"New data shows that the number of abortions fell by more than 10,000. In the first two months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, legal abortions nationwide declined by more than 10,000, a drop of about 6 percent, according to the first attempt at a nationwide count of abortions since the decision."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"A new motion argues that lifting the Covid-19 policy next month will open the door to a surge of migrants in their states. Fifteen states have intervened to try to keep in place a pandemic-related policy that allows the government to swiftly expel migrants arriving from Mexico, a prelude to Republican plans to push new security measures on the southern border."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"In Houston’s jail, where the population is at its highest in a decade, 24 people have died this year. More than half had a history of mental problems. Matthew Shelton was contending with diabetes and periodic substance abuse when he moved in with his sister outside Houston in order to get his life together."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"Cross-country can be a brutally hard sport, especially for runners who were phenoms in high school. For North Carolina State, the secret is simple. Moments after Katelyn Tuohy won the Division I women’s individual cross-country championship, she looked back at the horde of runners streaming into the finishing chute."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,Foes of the procedure champion the speech of some while trying to censor others. With the dismantling of Roe v. Wade has come a push to crack down on speech and information about reproductive rights.
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"Across the country, in both conservative and liberal communities, jails seem immune to change. On the morning of Sept. 14, the Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl stood on her front lawn barefoot as sheriff’s deputies raided her house, removing cellphones and laptops as part of an investigation into public corruption. Ms. Kuehl is one of the sheriff’s most prominent critics. And the same day, deputies raided the home of Patti Giggans, who, in addition to being a close friend and political ally of Ms. Kuehl, is a member of the civilian commission tasked with oversight of the sheriff’s office."
Oklahoma,2022,Q4,"The issue is whether a federal law that seeks to place Native American foster children in Native American homes is constitutional. The case could turn on whether the justices see tribes as racial groups or sovereign nations. The little girl who will soon be known by the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court as Y.R.J. is now 4 years old. For much of her short life she has been living with Dr. Jennifer Brackeen and Chad Brackeen, a suburban Texas couple fighting with the Navajo Nation to adopt her. Y.R.J.’s birth mother is Navajo. The Brackeens are white."

Oklahoma,2023,Q2,"Many measures of Black achievement in the U.S. have stalled or reversed. A series from Headway looks back at historical gains for their lessons today. Life expectancy is one of the oldest and surest indicators we have of both human suffering and human progress. Wars, famines, the 1918 flu, vaccines, pasteurization, rising crop yields — so many events over time are encoded in the line of life expectancy, but its overall astonishing ascent is among the best cases for 20th-century humankind that can be made."
Oklahoma,2023,Q2,"The court split 3-3 on whether to revive a much stricter six-week limit, enacted in 2018, that was struck down before Roe v. Wade was overturned. A legal attempt to ban abortion in Iowa after six weeks of pregnancy failed on Friday, after the State Supreme Court deadlocked over whether to vacate a lower court’s injunction and allow the ban to take effect. That means abortion will remain legal in Iowa through 20 weeks of pregnancy."

Oklahoma,2023,Q2,"The chemical, ammonium nitrate, is relatively harmless by itself but has caused deadly explosions in industrial accidents and has been used in targeted attacks. About 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used as a fertilizer and in explosives, went missing on a rail shipment from Wyoming to California in April and has still not been found, officials said."
Oklahoma,2023,Q2,"W.E.B. Du Bois saw the key to Black prosperity in places like Tulsa, where Black residents patronized Black stores. Even today it serves as a model. When W.E.B. Du Bois visited the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Okla., in early 1921, he, like so many others, was impressed by what he found. The famed intellectual had been on the road for weeks on a Southern lecture tour. In his travel diary, he wrote of brutal lynchings and brutalization that were as old as the nation itself — older, in fact.  What grabbed Du Bois’s attention was what his people were accomplishing despite it. “One notes all through the south, with some exception, the new hope and power of the colored folk,” he wrote in his diary. “It is not any increased faith in the white people — quite the contrary — it is a distinct sense of their own ability.”"
Oklahoma,2023,Q2,"The legislation, which includes an exemption for people already receiving treatment, now goes to the desk of the Republican governor. In the waning days of their legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday that would ban transition care for transgender youth."

Oklahoma,2023,Q3,"Now that the U.S. government has stepped back from issuing vaccines, long-term care operators have yet to start administering shots to protect one of the most vulnerable populations. “Covid is not pretty in a nursing home,” said Deb Wityk, a 70-year-old retired massage therapist who lives in one called Spurgeon Manor, in rural Iowa. She has contracted the disease twice, and is eager to get the newly approved vaccine because she has chronic leukemia, which weakens her immune system."
Oklahoma,2023,Q3,"Dangerous temperatures continue in Texas and the Southeast, with daily record temperatures possible from Florida to California. The forecast for the start of August feels very similar to the one for the start of July, with most of the Southeast, the Southern Plains and once again the Southwest facing temperatures or heat indexes in the triple digits."
Oklahoma,2023,Q3,"After Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, some feared that other court rulings, including the 2003 decision that invalidated sodomy laws, could be revisited. Maryland and Minnesota recently repealed theirs. It has been 20 years since the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws with its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, but legal codes inherited from colonial laws and used to prosecute L.G.B.T.Q. people by banning some sexual acts remain in place across the country."
Oklahoma,2023,Q3,"A reader wonders when it’s OK to abandon the undergarment. You are not the only one having an anti-bra moment. When many dressing mores went out the window during the pandemic lockdowns, the no-bra movement, which has resurfaced regularly since the 1960s, once again began picking up steam (led, in part, by Florence Pugh, above)."
Oklahoma,2023,Q3,"President Biden has promised to provide every American access to reliable high-speed internet. But some have raised concerns about whether the funds will achieve all of the administration’s goals. Along the southeastern edge of Oklahoma, where expansive cattle ranches and empty storefronts dot the landscape, the lack of high-speed internet service has become a daily frustration for residents."
Oklahoma,2023,Q3,"A group of politically vulnerable G.O.P. women has backed legislation that purports to expand birth control access but would have little effect. Critics say the bill is meant to distract from their anti-abortion stances. She had barely opened her town hall to questions when Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican from a competitive district in Iowa, was pressed to defend her opposition to abortion rights."
Oklahoma,2023,Q3,More than 57 million people were under an excessive heat warning — the most severe category for heat conditions — and another 54 million people were under a heat advisory.

Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term. The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows."
Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"A lower court is now expected to hear arguments on the broader question of whether the right to privacy in the state constitution protects a right to abortion. Georgia’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s prohibition of abortion Tuesday, rejecting arguments made by doctors and advocacy groups that the law was unconstitutional when the state legislature approved it in 2019, more than three years before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade."
Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"Stocks and bonds have tumbled worldwide, with the 30-year Treasury bill hitting a 16-year high. Investors are worried about the economy’s health. A far-right mutiny on Capitol Hill has sent markets into a tailspin. Skittish investors have dumped stocks and bonds this morning on fears that chaos in the Republican Party will cause a government shutdown next month and all but squash the fleeting hopes of a soft-landing economic recovery heading into an election year."
Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"A number of skirmishes unfolded in Congress as tempers flared ahead of a government shutdown deadline and Thanksgiving holiday break. The former G.O.P. speaker elbowed one of the Republicans who had voted to oust him. A Republican senator rose to challenge an organized labor leader to a brawl during a hearing. Across the Capitol, the chairman of a different panel compared a member of his committee to a cartoon character."
Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"Also, America’s deficit doubled. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. Hamas released an American mother and daughter who were kidnapped by the Palestinian group during its deadly Oct. 7 attack and held hostage for almost two weeks in Gaza. The Israeli military received them at the border and took them to an army base in central Israel to be reunited with family members."

Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"New rules from the Office of Management and Budget will change how the federal government weighs costs, enabling new efforts on climate change and poverty. The Biden administration has overhauled how the federal government assesses the costs and benefits of regulation and some government spending programs, clearing a path for more aggressive efforts to fight climate change and help the poor."
Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"Young men need to look for role models outside the attention economy. On Tuesday, Senator Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, decided to settle a social media beef in the middle of a Senate hearing labeled Standing Up Against Corporate Greed. Mullin read from a months-old post by Sean O’Brien, the president of the Teamsters, in which O’Brien called Mullin “a clown & fraud,” mocked the senator with an unflattering photo and the hashtag #LittleManSyndrome and challenged the senator to a fight: “Anyplace, Anytime cowboy,” O’Brien boasted."
Oklahoma,2023,Q4,"Yarros drew on her experience with chronic illness and life in a military family to write “Fourth Wing,” a huge best seller that spawned a spicy fantasy series. When Rebecca Yarros pitched her publisher a sexy fantasy about telepathic dragons and their riders, she thought it might be a tough sell."
Oklahoma,2024,Q1,"Seven medical supply companies made suspicious claims involving thousands of Medicare beneficiaries, an advocacy group found.

Oklahoma,2024,Q1,"Republican attorneys general from 24 states said the crackdown on fine industrial particles would raise costs. The E.P.A. said it would save lives.

Oklahoma,2024,Q1,Health care and semiconductor companies urged the White House to delay the auction of the federal helium system in Texas. But last month a private company was named the highest bidder. The way we get helium — which is used for everything from lifting rockets and balloons to cooling nuclear reactors and the machines used in an estimated 40 million M.R.I. scans done each year across the country — is about to change because of an auction of the federal helium reserves.
Oklahoma,2024,Q1,"The star, whose show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” has an international following, is one of the founders of a new online bookstore promoting underrepresented authors. The giveaways are part of its outreach. At a time of book bans and efforts by state legislatures to ban drag shows, the performer and television producer who is arguably the country’s most famous drag star, RuPaul, is the co-founder of a new online bookstore that will be sending a rainbow school bus from the West Coast to the South to distribute the very books targeted by those bans."
Oklahoma,2024,Q1,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has yet to disclose why he has been at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for the past week. The Pentagon came under increased pressure Sunday to explain why senior Biden administration officials, congressional representatives and the president himself were not notified of the hospitalization of Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III until days later."
Oklahoma,2024,Q1,"The impact on global growth of the Middle East violence has so far been contained. That’s not the case for Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan, which were already struggling.

The threat of escalation there and around flash points in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and now Iran and Pakistan ratchets up every day."

Oklahoma,2024,Q1,"Carve the names of climate change deniers deep and large, so that those who come after us need not search the archives. Here is a proposal for the environmental movement: Pool philanthropic funds for a day, buy a small plot of land in Washington, D.C., and put up a tall marble wall to serve as a climate memorial.

Oklahoma,2024,Q3,"When a sequel comes out, it can be an occasion to reaffirm why you love the original. It recently came to my attention that several people I count as good friends have been engaged for decades in quietly impassioned romances with the same 1996 summer disaster movie. That movie is “Twister,” the story of a lovably eclectic band of tornado chasers who follow soon-to-be-divorced Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt right into the eye of many storms. It featured a 29-year-old Philip Seymour Hoffman, a storm-tracking device named “Dorothy” and a flying bovine, the sight of which inspires one character to get off the phone with the line: “I gotta go, Julia. We got cows.”"

The coming months may also bring voting disputes that could decide the presidential election."

Oklahoma,2024,Q4,"A new analysis shows how many women in states with bans are seeking procedures or pills from out-of-state providers.

Wade."
Oklahoma,2024,Q4,"After gains by organized labor under President Biden, a second Trump administration is likely to change course on regulation and enforcement. Joseph R.

Oregon,2020,Q2,"Born in lily-white Oregon, it’s a sport that’s long claimed to be for everyone — even as African-American joggers have been persistently subjected to harassment and worse. Free! Easy!

Oregon,2020,Q3,"Viral posts about a man who was arrested and accused of setting fires in Portland, Ore., have left out one important fact: Those fires were quickly put out.

Oregon,2020,Q4,"Marijuana measures are on the ballot in several states that once resisted them. Oregon would go further with a proposal to decriminalize drugs like heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Oregon has an addiction problem. Pockets of rural poverty, chronic homelessness and cities with lots of young people have given the state one of the highest rates of substance abuse in the nation. It is also, because there is so little money allocated to it, one of the toughest places to get treatment."
Oregon,2020,Q4,"Voters in red and blue states may be in accord on nothing else, but they passed measures to liberalize drug laws. One of America’s greatest mistakes over the last century was the war on drugs, so it’s thrilling to see voters in red and blue states alike moving to unwind it."

Oregon,2021,Q1,"“Things are tenuous,” says Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director. “Now is not the time to relax restrictions.” The federal government warned impatient governors against relaxing pandemic control measures on Friday, saying that a recent steep drop in U.S. coronavirus cases and deaths “may be stalling” and “potentially leveling off at still a very high number” — a worrisome development that comes as more cases of concerning new variants have been found and could suggest that a return to normalcy is not yet quite as near as many Americans had hoped."

In North Dakota this week, health officials are sending their first Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines to pharmacies and urgent care clinics, where people who don’t necessarily have a regular doctor can get the single jab. In Missouri, doses are going to community health centers and rural hospitals. And in North Carolina, health providers are using it to inoculate meatpacking, farm and grocery workers."
Oregon,2021,Q1,"The stockpile of doses was nearly empty.

Oregon,2021,Q2,"The actions represented a broad repudiation of former President Donald J. Trump, and his practice of using executive orders to advance his political agenda.

When the book is written about how states across the country tried to persuade people to get coronavirus vaccines, it will not accuse New Mexico of being subtle."
Oregon,2021,Q2,"For some, the decision to die is more complicated than a wish to reduce pain.

Oregon,2021,Q3,"France and Italy are seeking to bolster vaccination rates by making it harder for the unvaccinated to visit public venues including restaurants and sporting events.

Oregon,2021,Q3,"“It’s not a role I relish,” Gov. Kathy C. Hochul said. “But I also realistically know that there are people who will not come back to their jobs.” Tens of thousands of health care workers in New York appeared to be risking their jobs by defying a state mandate to receive a dose of a coronavirus vaccine by Monday, setting up an early test for similar employer mandates across the United States."
Oregon,2021,Q3,"The infrastructure bill could reshape priorities across the country, jump-starting critical projects that stalled over funding. These are some of the possibilities. WASHINGTON — In the Pacific Northwest, the aging Interstate 5 bridge, a main artery between Oregon and Washington, is at risk of collapsing in a major earthquake.

And along the Gulf Coast, states like Louisiana are forced to consider novel evacuation routes to ease traffic on inland highways that often become clogged before powerful hurricanes."

Last winter, workers at a memory care facility in western Oregon decided they were done watching the residents suffer. Conditions at the Rawlin at Riverbend, a 72-bed home in Springfield, were horrific because of critically low staffing and a lack of training. Elderly residents screamed from their rooms for assistance, and workers had to make the kinds of decisions that people are forced to make in war: Do you take precious time to do emergency wound care, even though you aren’t quite sure how, knowing that it means other residents might sit in their own feces for hours or trip and fall in the hallways?

Oregon,2022,Q3,"The measure passed on an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the last action in the House before lawmakers departed to campaign ahead of the November midterm elections. WASHINGTON — In its final vote before lawmakers left Washington for November’s midterm elections, the House on Friday overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation that would authorize $2.7 billion in compensation payments to the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks."
Oregon,2022,Q3,"After his acquittal for inciting a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he became a leading environmental toxicologist, shaping government safety standards. John R. Froines, a quiet but politically stalwart chemist who stood trial alongside six other antiwar activists — known collectively as the Chicago Seven — on charges of conspiring to incite a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and who went on to become a pioneering advocate for environmental justice, died on Wednesday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 83."
Oregon,2022,Q3,"In the aftermath of the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, there has been a flurry of activity in the states as officials move to prohibit or expand abortion access.

Oregon,2022,Q3,"The move is part of a long-anticipated effort by the Biden administration to overhaul the underfunded, scandal-plagued Federal Bureau of Prisons. WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is finalizing long-awaited plans to overhaul the troubled Federal Bureau of Prisons, which include a recommendation to increase sentences for prison employees found guilty of sexual abuse against inmates, according to people familiar with the situation."
Oregon,2022,Q3,"Based on the book about psychedelic therapy, a new Netflix docu-series prompted another writer to reach out to Pollan — and dig into his own experiences. In late 2012, the best-selling author and journalist Michael Pollan (“The Omnivore’s Dilemma”) was at a dinner party in Berkeley, Calif. Among his fellow diners was a prominent developmental psychiatrist, in her 60s, who spoke at some length about a recent LSD trip. This pricked up Pollan’s ears."
Oregon,2022,Q3,"Experts say there is no indication that vaccines affect fertility. Most people’s periods go back to normal within one cycle. Some people experience headaches or sore arms after getting vaccinated. Others may have nausea or swollen lymph nodes. Now, a growing body of research is pointing to yet another potential side effect of Covid-19 vaccines: changes in menstrual cycles."
Oregon,2022,Q3,"The Biden administration is in talks with tribes, environmental groups and others fighting for dams to be removed from the lower Snake River in the Pacific Northwest. WASHINGTON — After decades of legal fighting over hydroelectric dams that have contributed to the depletion of salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest, the Biden administration is extending settlement talks with plaintiffs who hope the resolution they are seeking — removal of the dams — is near."
Oregon,2022,Q3,Take roof trusses. Many of us are intrigued by wonders that scream “THE FUTURE” like flying cars. But sometimes the best inventions are more about brain power than technology magic. Let me give you a couple of examples in my quest to appreciate the ingenuity in boring things.
Oregon,2022,Q4,"Governors can do many things to mess with reproductive rights. I called Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, on Monday morning to see how worried he was about New York’s governor’s race. Levine, a Democrat who’d just come from campaigning with Gov. Kathy Hochul, was pretty worried. Yes, polls have shown Hochul consistently ahead of the Trumpist Republican congressman Lee Zeldin, but Levine thought the race could go either way."
Oregon,2022,Q4,"After record warmth, the region is set to cool down this weekend. Wildfires burning across the Pacific Northwest through a season of record-breaking heat and dry weather have spread a blanket of smoke across Seattle, Portland and other parts of the region, where residents are breathing some of the planet’s worst air this week."
Oregon,2022,Q4,"The report by Senate Democrats points to widespread misbehavior by the plans and the marketing firms they hire. Companies selling private Medicare plans to older adults have posed as the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies, misled customers about the size of their networks and preyed on vulnerable people with dementia and cognitive impairment, according to a new investigation of deceptive marketing practices in the industry released Thursday by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee."
Oregon,2022,Q4,"Policies in some states are also hurting efforts to keep children safe. Twenty-three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States. Last month, the C.D.C. joined with the World Health Organization to warn that the disease, which vaccines can prevent, had become “an imminent threat in every region in the world.”"
Oregon,2022,Q4,"A C.D.C. study estimates that, over five years, one in eight deaths of people ages 20 to 64 occurred because of alcohol-related injuries or illness. An estimated one in eight deaths of Americans ages 20 to 64 in the years 2015-19 was the result of injuries or illness caused by excessive alcohol use, according to a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Oregon,2022,Q4,"Hemp with high THC content given to Holsteins leached into their milk, according to a group of German scientists exploring the food chain for dairy production. Do cows that consume cannabis act goofy, get the munchies and spend more time lolling about with their stoned buddies?"
Oregon,2022,Q4,"As an obscure but muscular congressional staffer and chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, he helped usher into law a raft of consumer protections. Few people outside Washington had ever heard of the consumer advocate Michael Pertschuk by the mid-1970s, but he was considered so influential in Congress that friends and foes alike anointed him “the 101st senator,” and the cigarette maker Philip Morris proclaimed him the company’s “number one enemy.”"
Oregon,2022,Q4,"To heal the body politic, we must cure our socioeconomic crisis. Has America’s fever broken?"
Oregon,2022,Q4,"R.S.V. has probably peaked, but flu is still surging and Covid-19 cases are rising. Scientists are hopeful next winter will be better. It has become wearyingly routine: Americans are embarking upon yet another holiday travel season in the midst of a viral onslaught."
Oregon,2022,Q4,"The organ is “completely ignored by pretty much everyone,” medical experts say, and that omission can be devastating to women’s sexual health. If there was one thing Gillian knew, it was that she did not want a hole punch anywhere near her genitals."

Oregon,2023,Q2,"The F.D.A. urges checking freezers for the affected products sold at Walmart, Costco, Trader Joe’s and other retailers. A voluntary recall of frozen strawberries has been expanded as the Food and Drug Administration has linked more retailers to a string of nine hepatitis A cases that date back to last year."
Oregon,2023,Q2,Laws like the Florida bill will cause harm whether or not direct censorship takes place. Florida Republicans on Wednesday expanded a state law that prohibits classroom instruction on L.G.B.T.Q. subjects through third grade. Now the “Don’t Say Gay” law will also apply to students in grades four to 12.
Oregon,2023,Q2,"Nearly three-quarters of hospice organizations are now for-profit. Complaints of fraud and profiteering are growing. In the nearly 20 years that Megan Stainer worked in nursing homes in and around Detroit, she could almost always tell which patients near death were receiving care from nonprofit hospice organizations and which from for-profit hospices."
Oregon,2023,Q2,"The Times reviewed 101 studies of medication abortion, spanning continents and decades. All concluded that the pills are a safe method for terminating a pregnancy. The Times reviewed 101 studies of medication abortion, spanning continents and decades. All concluded that the pills are a safe method for terminating a pregnancy."
Oregon,2023,Q2,"As MDMA and psilocybin treatments become more mainstream, the therapy component has come under scrutiny. Here’s what’s common in many sessions — and what’s not. Psychedelic therapy is on its way to becoming a mainstream medical treatment in mental health care. In 2020 and 2022, residents of Oregon and Colorado voted to legalize the use of psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms, and the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve it and MDMA, or Ecstasy, to treat depression and post-traumatic stress disorder by 2024."
Oregon,2023,Q2,"Some experts and elected officials say New York’s leaders should have responded more quickly to the wildfire smoke that pushed air quality to historically unhealthy levels. New Yorkers have grown accustomed to being inundated with well-intentioned warnings from city and state leaders, for everything from incoming snowstorms to virus outbreaks."
Oregon,2023,Q2,"Experts call it a consequential change in the care of some older people and others with limits on their mental functioning. Conservative Texans and liberal Californians disagree on much in politics. But legislators in both states agree on a new approach to giving people with cognitive impairments a greater chance for self-determination. It’s called supported decision-making, and it is shaping up to be the most consequential change in the care of older people and others with limitations in mental functioning since the rise of advance care directives in the 1990s."
Oregon,2023,Q2,"A business owner’s personal story can bolster trust in a brand, experts say. But what happens when they share hardships like homelessness, addiction or incarceration in company marketing? Hakki Akdeniz, the founder of the Champion Pizza chain in New York City, speaks freely about his past. When he first moved to the United States from Canada in 2001, he was homeless, sleeping in subway cars and at Grand Central Terminal before staying at a shelter for three months."
Oregon,2023,Q2,"Scientists say alarming declines at the southern end of the fishes’ range may be a sign of what’s to come as waters warm farther north. This week, officials are expected to shut down all commercial and recreational salmon fishing off California for 2023. Much will be canceled off neighboring Oregon, too."
Oregon,2023,Q2,"In the campaign to ban gender therapies for minors, Republicans have amplified a group of activists who no longer identify as transgender, overriding objections from transgender people and medical experts. When Missouri lawmakers took up bills to ban transition care for minors, Chloe Cole, an activist from California, traveled to Jefferson City to offer her story as Exhibit A."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"Numerous wildfires in Canada, Washington and Oregon sparked air quality alerts and evacuations across the region. At least one person has died. Thick smoke blanketed much of the Pacific Northwest on Monday as numerous wildfires in Canada, Washington and Oregon continued to burn, killing at least one person, destroying scores of buildings and threatening dozens more."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"Though some Air Quality Index spikes have been caused by wildfires, this time it was a fire at a paper mill in Washington. Some counties are under an air pollution advisory until Friday. Air quality levels in Portland, Ore., reached “unhealthy” levels and were among the worst in the nation on Wednesday. Although wildfires in the region and beyond have been behind some of the recent spikes in air quality levels, this time the culprit was a factory fire an hour north of the city."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"How soon is too soon to call a progressive and libertarian policy obsession a public policy fiasco? How soon is too soon to call a progressive and libertarian policy obsession a public policy fiasco? In the case of Oregon’s Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act, better known as Measure 110, the moment can’t come soon enough."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"The plaintiffs want the state to drop its residency requirement. Oregon and Vermont have already done so. Judy Govatos has heard that magical phrase “you’re in remission” twice, in 2015 and again in 2019. She had beaten back Stage 4 lymphoma with such aggressive chemotherapy and other treatments that at one point she grew too weak to stand, and relied on a wheelchair. She endured several hospitalizations, suffered infections and lost nearly 20 pounds. But she prevailed."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"Oregon decriminalized all drugs, and overdoses have surged. When Oregon was getting ready to vote on whether to decriminalize all drugs in 2020, I was covering the story for Vox. During my interviews with the leaders of the decriminalization campaign, they often cited Portugal. It decriminalized all drugs in 2000. In the years after, Portugal’s drug-related problems declined."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"Attracted by promises of high returns, many public pension funds have been loading up on private equity but may not fully appreciate the dangers, our columnist says. The Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund prides itself on being open about its investments, publishing monthly reports that provide more timely information than most other state and local government pension plans across the country."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"The overdose-reversal drug should be more widely available, health experts have said. It arrives in many stores next week, no prescription necessary. Narcan, the first opioid overdose reversal medication approved for over-the-counter purchase, is being shipped to drugstore and grocery chains nationwide, its manufacturer said Wednesday. Big-box outlets like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart and Rite Aid said they expected Narcan to be available online and on many store shelves early next week."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"The theme “No Place Like Home” will drive shows and festivals in both large cities and rural locales of this country on July 27, 2024. One night in the fall of 1936, with Fascism rising in Europe, theaters in 18 cities and towns across the United States staged productions of the dystopian play, “It Can’t Happen Here,” under the auspices of the Federal Theater Project, which was created to provide Depression-era artists with work."
Oregon,2023,Q3,"Coffee is linked with lots of health benefits, but most of the risks come from the caffeine. Q: I routinely drink three or four cups of coffee per day, but often wonder if this is too much. Should I consider cutting back?"
Oregon,2023,Q3,"Some doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are fleeing restrictive abortion laws. Idaho has been particularly hard hit. One by one, doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are disappearing from Idaho — part of a wave of obstetricians fleeing restrictive abortion laws and a hostile state legislature. Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, a family doctor who also delivers babies in the tiny mountain town of McCall, is among those left behind, facing a lonely and uncertain future."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"A grand jury indicted Joseph Emerson, who said he thought he was dreaming in the cockpit, on lesser charges of endangering an aircraft and reckless endangerment of the passengers and crew. A pilot accused of trying to crash an Alaska Airlines jetliner in Oregon will no longer face charges of attempted murder. A grand jury voted instead to indict the pilot, Joseph Emerson, on a felony charge of endangering an aircraft and 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, officials said on Tuesday."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"A congressional investigation found that the nation’s largest pharmacies have handed over prescription records to law enforcement without a warrant, raising privacy concerns. Law enforcement agencies have obtained the prescription records of thousands of Americans from the country’s largest pharmacy chains without a warrant, a congressional inquiry found, raising concerns about how the companies handle patient privacy."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"Friday was the third day of a walkout for thousands of health care employees. No new contract talks were scheduled until next week. Kaiser Permanente health care workers were finishing a three-day strike on Friday, and were expected to return to work early Saturday morning without a new contract."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"Corrections that appeared in print on Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2023. A photo with an article on Monday about congressional retirements was published in error. The image of Carl Wilson, a former member of the Oregon House of Representatives, was included where an image of Representative Earl Blumenauer should have appeared."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"Health care policymakers and industry leaders must reckon with the difficulties facing workers if we want to avert strikes. In April 2020, when I would walk home after a long day treating patients in a New York City emergency room, an orchestra of pots and pans would erupt from seemingly every window to honor frontline workers. Nothing could make those early pandemic days easier for me and my colleagues, but those haphazard symphonies of appreciation helped keep us going. At that time, health care workers had every reason to hope that once the Covid-19 pandemic waned, long-overdue and much needed changes to our health care system would finally materialize."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"Immigrants who worked decades on U.S. farms are reaching retirement age in a country that offers them neither Medicare nor Social Security. Esperanza Sanchez spends eight hours a day, Sunday to Friday, crouched down to the ground, trimming and picking leafy greens and packing them into boxes."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"Many of the children were eligible for federal aid, experts said, but errors have been common as states “unwind” assistance from earlier in the coronavirus pandemic. At least two million low-income children have lost health insurance since the end of a federal policy that guaranteed coverage through Medicaid earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new analyses by researchers at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families and KFF, a health policy research organization."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"A variety of common canine pathogens, none of them new, could be driving the recent outbreaks. Scientists and health officials are scrambling to find an explanation for the outbreaks of severe respiratory illness that have been sickening dogs across the United States."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"Looking after a sick family member can mean putting your own life on hold, often with little recognition or outside support. Ann Brenoff didn’t worry when her dogs returned from a walk without her husband in 2015. He often dropped their leashes and let them race up the steep driveway to their home in the canyons of Los Angeles. “But after 20 or 30 minutes, we said ‘OK, where’s Dad?’” said Ms. Brenoff, 73, whose two children were then teenagers."
Oregon,2023,Q4,"An all-American at Purdue, he was the youngest member of the gold medal-winning 1960 U.S. Olympic team. He later became a top N.B.A. rookie. Terry Dischinger, one of the greatest players in Purdue University basketball history and the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic team that won a gold medal in Rome in 1960, died on Oct. 9 in Lake Oswego, Ore. He was 82."
Oregon,2024,Q1,"To confront the crises of homelessness and mental illness, California has passed new laws that critics say could violate the civil liberties of those suffering on the streets. Some families welcome the new measures. When LaVonne Collette’s adult daughter, Tamra, needed a place to stay during the pandemic after being evicted, Ms. Collette let her live in a rental property she owns in Los Angeles not far from Venice Beach. That didn’t go well."
Oregon,2024,Q1,"Nicholas Kristof on the most effective recovery program he’s ever seen. Nicholas Kristof has spent a lot of time reporting on addiction. “My own community in Oregon has suffered a great deal from it. I’ve lost a lot of friends to it,” he says. In a recent trip to Tulsa, Okla., Kristof visited Women in Recovery, an addiction treatment program showing what’s possible. In this audio essay, he introduces us to a program graduate, Katelyn Fullbright, who struggled with cocaine and meth addiction but now holds a full-time job she enjoys."
Oregon,2024,Q1,"Rizo-López Foods recalled its dairy products this week, as officials linked some of them to an outbreak that has sickened 26 people since 2014. A listeria outbreak that has sickened at least 26 people in 11 states since 2014 has been linked to queso fresco and cotija cheese made by Rizo-López Foods, a California-based food supplier, federal public health officials said this week."
Oregon,2024,Q1,"Americans may be advised that it’s safe to return to regular routines after one day without a fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering loosening its recommendations regarding how long people should isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus, another reflection of changing attitudes and norms as the pandemic recedes."
Oregon,2024,Q1,"Officials said the move was intended to remove barriers to contraceptive care, as part of the state’s mission to protect reproductive rights. New Yorkers will soon be able to get a year’s worth of hormonal birth control from pharmacies without a prescription."
Oregon,2024,Q1,"Psychoactive mushrooms, illegal under federal law, are gaining popularity as therapy tools. Some experts worry that the market is growing faster than the research. Seizures of psychedelic mushrooms across the nation by law enforcement officials have increased significantly in recent years as attitudes regarding their use have grown more permissive, according to a government-funded study released Tuesday."
Oregon,2024,Q1,The F.T.C. and H.H.S. are examining the tactics of group purchasing organizations that generic industry executives say have led to scarce supplies of treatments like chemotherapy. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday that they would examine the causes of generic drug shortages and the practices of “powerful middlemen” that are involved in the supply chain.
Oregon,2024,Q1,"Receiving multidose vaccinations in both arms, instead of just one, may increase the immune response, new research suggests. If you’ve presented the same arm for every dose of a particular vaccine, you may want to reconsider. Alternating arms may produce a more powerful immune response, a new study suggests."
Oregon,2024,Q1,"In newly disclosed documents, federal researchers find that cannabis may have medical uses and is less likely to cause harm than drugs like heroin. Marijuana is neither as risky nor as prone to abuse as other tightly controlled substances and has potential medical benefits, and therefore should be removed from the nation’s most restrictive category of drugs, federal scientists have concluded."
Oregon,2024,Q1,Lawmakers want shopkeepers to remove e-cigarettes that were not authorized by the F.D.A. Retailers say it is not that simple. The chairmen of five key Senate committees on Thursday warned the chief executives of major convenience stores and wholesalers to stop sales of illicit flavored vaping products that they called “widespread violations of federal law.”
Oregon,2024,Q2,"Cats are more social than they are often given credit for. Can you help yours access its inner dog? Over the last two decades, a flurry of scientific studies have demonstrated, over and over again, that dogs are social savants, highly attuned to human cues."
Oregon,2024,Q2,"Deaths of infants in the state increased by 13 percent in 2022, a study found, driven by fatal birth defects. New data from Texas shows a possible consequence of abortion bans: a rise in infant mortality."
Oregon,2024,Q2,"Some scientists who study youth mental health say the evidence does not support the notion that social media is harmful per se. When the U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, announced on Monday that he was planning to push for a mental health warning label on social media platforms, he was met with cheers from many parents and teachers, who described a long, lonely struggle to wrench children away from a habit that was hurting them."
Oregon,2024,Q2,The fight over a new stadium for the Eugene Emeralds highlights a wider challenge for cheaper alternatives to big-league live sports. Ed Willson has a jar filled with dirt sitting on his desk.
Oregon,2024,Q2,"Several lawmakers questioned whether the company had become so large — with tentacles in every aspect of the nation’s medical care — that the effects of the hack were outsize. In a tense Senate hearing on Wednesday, lawmakers sharply criticized UnitedHealth Group’s handling of the cyberattack that paralyzed the U.S. health care system, citing the failure of its security systems and the potential disclosure of sensitive medical information of millions of Americans."
Oregon,2024,Q2,"A lawsuit by a group of homeless residents of a small Oregon town could reshape the way cities across the country deal with homelessness. Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon."
Oregon,2024,Q2,"Organizations that describe themselves as churches are providing psychedelics to followers. The compounds, which show promise as treatments for depression, are illegal in most settings. Facing the latest participants attending her four-day psychedelic retreat, Whitney Lasseter made a bold claim: The ceremonies they would take part in were sanctioned by federal law, which sets a high bar for the government to interfere in religious practices."
Oregon,2024,Q2,"The long-serving congressman from Portland, who has become the top marijuana advocate on Capitol Hill, believes the issue could boost President Biden’s support with young voters. As a 23-year-old serving his first term in the Oregon state legislature, Representative Earl Blumenauer cosponsored the first bill in the country to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana."
Oregon,2024,Q2,"As voters’ frustration has grown with sprawling tent encampments in public spaces, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping. The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation’s most liberal states."
Oregon,2024,Q2,"Laws aren’t keeping pace with the risks climate change poses to workers laboring under sweltering conditions. A record-breaking heat wave is cresting across the United States, with about 100 million people under extreme heat alerts. Local TV news stations, governors and health officials advise to plan accordingly, drink water, go to cooling centers if needed and above all, refrain from excess outdoor exertion."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"One man is being held without bail after a witness saw him push a flaming vehicle down an embankment on Wednesday, the authorities said. The Park fire has burned more than 164,000 acres. An enormous wildfire in Northern California has destroyed buildings, left at least two people injured and prompted evacuation orders for thousands of people as it raged in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. As of early Friday morning, the fire had burned more than 164,000 acres, making it the state’s largest fire so far this year."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"A Public Health Service employee, he turned whistle-blower after learning of decades-long research involving hundreds of poor, infected Black men who were left untreated. Peter Buxtun, a whistle-blower who in 1972 exposed a 40-year government experiment to track the effects of syphilis in Black men in Alabama — who were neither told that they had the disease nor offered treatment — died on May 18 in Rocklin, Calif., near Sacramento. He was 86."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"Patients received “substantial” payments, their lawyers said, and the clinic agreed to staffing changes. Yale agreed on Monday to pay dozens of patients who had filed lawsuits claiming that they had endured excruciatingly painful egg retrieval procedures after a nurse at its fertility clinic secretly swapped their anesthesia for saline."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"MultiPlan has helped big health insurers make billions by reducing reimbursements for medical bills, but its business model is now being questioned. Already under investigation in Congress, a data analytics firm that has helped major health insurers make billions of dollars by reducing reimbursements for medical bills is facing growing scrutiny from Wall Street and in the courts."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"At the 1960 Summer Games in Rome, he set a world record in the 400-meter race and another in the 4 x 400 relay, where he anchored the United States team’s victory. Otis Davis, who was not allowed to attend the University of Alabama, in his home state, because he was Black, but flourished at the University of Oregon, which became his springboard to winning two gold medals in sprints at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, died on Saturday in hospice care in North Bergen, N.J. He was 92."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"As heat waves become more frequent and intense, researchers and activists say the lack of precise data is leading to needless fatalities. After a string of scorching days in June 2023, the body of an 88-year-old man was discovered in his home in Maricopa County, Ariz. His air-conditioner, set to 70, was blowing hot air. The temperature inside was nearly 110 degrees. Maybe he had heart problems. Maybe a different organ broke down. Maybe he was taking medications that did not work as they should. Did extreme heat cause or contribute to his death?"
Oregon,2024,Q3,"The agency said there was insufficient data to allow the use of a treatment for PTSD that involves the drug known as Ecstasy. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday declined to approve MDMA-assisted therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, dealing a serious blow to the nascent field of psychedelic medicine and dashing the hopes of many Americans who are desperate for new treatments."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"A recent study detected a number of metals in many types of tampons. Experts weigh in on the findings and what they could mean for your health. A new study about tampons has sparked concern among consumers. The research, published in the journal Environment International, found evidence of 16 different metals in a wide range of tampons sold in the United States and Europe."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"Medical providers and public health experts worry that the health care system is poorly equipped to handle the influx. On a recent Friday in Albuquerque, as triple-digit temperatures stretched into the evening, a 69-year-old man collapsed in his home. His body temperature hit 107.7 degrees by the time emergency responders whisked him to the University of New Mexico Hospital."
Oregon,2024,Q3,"We asked experts about the right time to get a shot, and how long protection will last. The Food and Drug Administration approved updated Covid-19 vaccines on Thursday, paving the way for the shots to soon land in pharmacies, doctors’ offices and health centers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will recommend that adults and children six months and older get updated vaccines. Here’s what to know."
Oregon,2024,Q4,"If every emergency room in the United States were fully prepared to treat children, thousands of lives would be saved and the cost would be $11.84 or less per child, researchers found. The morning after Phyllis Rabinowitz brought her newborn daughter home from the hospital, she knew something was terribly wrong. The baby, Rebecca, had thick mucus, trouble breathing and lethargy unlike anything Ms. Rabinowitz had seen in her first child."
Oregon,2024,Q4,"The U.S. needs to reassure the world it has the outbreak under control. As a virus scientist in South Africa, I’ve been watching with dread as H5N1 bird flu spreads among animals in the United States.

Pennsylvania,2022,Q1,"Not all health plans will be ready for the Covid tests to be free upfront at stores, relying at first on receipts and reimbursement.

She was 83."
Pennsylvania,2022,Q2,"Why health care needs labor peace agreements. America was in a health care crisis before Covid, and the stresses of the pandemic have made it worse. Since the pandemic began, the health care work force — the country’s largest industry by employment — has shrunk by nearly 2 percent. That may seem like a small amount, but historically, the health care work force doesn’t shrink; it only grows. Now, with astronomical turnover and rising demand as patients seek care that they may have put off during the height of the pandemic, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and home care agencies across the country lack sufficient staff members to adequately care for patients."

Pennsylvania,2022,Q2,"A career in health journalism has taught me that when it comes to living well, it’s the inner workout that counts the most.

Pennsylvania,2022,Q2,"The former president threw his weight behind the celebrity doctor, who is running for the Republican nomination for senator in a key state. Wading into a tight Republican Senate primary in Pennsylvania, former President Donald J.

Pennsylvania,2022,Q2,"As he recovers from a stroke, the Democratic Senate nominee in Pennsylvania is running a virtual campaign of online memes and withering mockery of his opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz. When John Fetterman, the rangy, 6-foot-8 aspiring senator from Pennsylvania, suffered a stroke on a Friday in mid-May, his medical emergency alarmed Democratic strategists as well as the unusual personal network of artists, activists and admiring celebrities he’s built up during a decade-plus in politics."

Pennsylvania,2022,Q2,"The Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v.

Another vote is planned for this week.

Pennsylvania,2022,Q3,"Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania, has taunted his Democratic rival, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, about his recovery. It began with a spat over crudités. It has escalated, with one Senate hopeful openly mocking another’s health after a stroke."
Pennsylvania,2022,Q3,"Health doesn’t have to be so political.  The principal intent of campaigns is to give voice to the candidates’ positions on major issues. When casting their ballots, voters consider personality, party allegiance, character traits and other factors. In Pennsylvania’s Senate election, a candidate’s personal health has come to the fore, and the outcome could be a key in determining control of the Senate."

Pennsylvania,2022,Q3,Patients push back on a medical behemoth in this persuasive health care documentary. “InHospitable” is a decent advocacy documentary that compellingly argues a couple of points that aren’t easy to make compelling onscreen. One is that supposedly nonprofit hospitals often behave more like for-profit hospitals and don’t provide benefits commensurate with the tax breaks they receive. Another is that hospital mergers and anticompetitive practices tend to increase costs for patients.
Pennsylvania,2022,Q3,"Doctors who want to prescribe tecovirimat, or Tpoxx, must navigate a gantlet of bureaucratic hurdles that experts say could be quickly lifted.

Pennsylvania,2022,Q4,"The Democratic candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania will use closed captioning to assist with the after effects of a stroke.

For years, people who had polycystic ovary syndrome and were also overweight were told that their symptoms would improve if they lost weight via a restrictive diet. In 2018, a leading group of PCOS experts recommended that overweight or obese women with the hormonal disorder consider reducing their caloric intake by up to 750 calories a day.

Rhode Island,2021,Q4,"The looming wave is shaking the rickety infrastructure that has kept schools running. This is our final Education Briefing newsletter for 2021 — and it’s sobering to have to end the year with a look at another wave of Covid, and the toll on the mental health of our students."
Rhode Island,2021,Q4,"President Biden came into office vowing to make testing cheap and accessible, but matching supply with demand has been a persistent problem. WASHINGTON — The nation’s coronavirus testing capacity, already straining to keep up with demand, is facing enormous new pressure, with holiday travelers waiting in long lines to be tested, overworked laboratories struggling to keep up and rapid at-home diagnostics flying off pharmacy shelves as the Omicron variant fuels a rapid spike in Covid-19 cases."
Rhode Island,2021,Q4,"Vaccinated residents who had embraced a return to some normalcy are unsettled: “It’s scary — it feels like we’ve been here before.” Holiday plans abruptly reversing, restaurants closing, Broadway shows going dark while, blocks away, long lines form outside testing sites — it’s as if it were 2020 all over again."
Rhode Island,2021,Q4,"If the C.D.C. agrees, adults who received a second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine at least six months ago could be eligible by this weekend.

Rhode Island,2022,Q1,"Sex differences in Covid death rates vary widely from state to state, suggesting they are rooted in behavior as well as biology. It’s one of the most well-known takeaways of the pandemic: Men die of Covid-19 more often than women do."
Rhode Island,2022,Q1,Federal health officials say they are not planning on recommending fourth doses any time soon. Protection from Covid vaccine boosters might be shorter than we would have hoped.
Rhode Island,2022,Q1,"Scientists agree we need an off-ramp, but when? New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island today became the latest states to announce that they would do away with mask mandates. They join a string of blue-state governors who have abruptly abandoned mask rules, even as the Biden administration remains more cautious about relaxing Covid safety measures."

John Faulkner, 76, was becoming emotionally withdrawn before he arrived at Central Parke Assisted Living and Memory Care, the community where he lives in Mason, Ohio.

By the time Mr. Faulkner arrived at Central Parke, he would sit alone in his room for hours, according to Esther Mwilu, who organizes activities for the community."
Rhode Island,2022,Q2,"Catherine Miller, the show’s prop master, talks about how her team sourced and made the eerie objects that define Lumon.

Rhode Island,2022,Q2," A novel Michigan lawsuit will attempt to continue to make abortion available. As I read the U.S. Supreme Court’s draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, I was devastated.

Rhode Island,2022,Q2,"Wasn’t this supposed to be the summer of big plans? Inflation, Covid-19 and instability have some travelers putting away their passports and grabbing their weekender bags: The close-to-home vacation isn’t dead yet.

Rhode Island,2022,Q2,"Jonathan Malesic responds to readers concerned about the breakdown in college students’ learning since Covid. In my May 13 guest essay, “My College Students Are Not OK,” I described an apparent breakdown in college students’ learning after more than two years of disruption by Covid. “Universities need to help students rebuild their ability to learn,” I wrote. “And to do that, everyone involved — students, faculties, administrators and the public at large — must insist on in-person classes and high expectations for fall 2022 and beyond.”"
Rhode Island,2022,Q2,"Thrown together by New York City’s brutal housing market, these roommates find a way to get by — even in close quarters. Two facts are painfully clear to New Yorkers: The rent is too high, and it keeps getting higher. With the median one-bedroom apartment hovering around $3,500 a month, New York’s rents are officially among the most expensive in the country. Between 2009 and 2018, the city added 500,000 jobs but only 100,000 new housing units. The profound shortage in rental units has forced the city’s residents to figure out their own ways to live affordably."
Rhode Island,2022,Q3,"Make the most of the last weeks of summer, whether you’re dreading the end of the season or dancing about it. We’re nearing the middle of August, summer at its ripest.

Rhode Island,2022,Q3,"We asked people who quit their jobs during the “Great Resignation” how it changed how they approach work. This is what they told us. In September 2021, Evelyn Lai sat at the brown teak desk in her childhood bedroom and looked out the window. She felt just as uncertain as she had two decades ago."
Rhode Island,2022,Q3,"On abortion, climate change, guns and much more, two Americas — one liberal, one conservative — are moving in opposite directions. Pressed by Supreme Court decisions diminishing rights that liberals hold dear and expanding those cherished by conservatives, the United States appears to be drifting apart into separate nations, with diametrically opposed social, environmental and health policies."
Rhode Island,2022,Q3,"The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has prompted Democratic governors to pitch their states as better alternatives for business. As a group of conservative states enacted severe abortion restrictions last year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois sent letters to a handful of corporate executives with close ties to Texas."

Rhode Island,2022,Q3,"In Britain, artists lit a structure aflame. At the Jersey Shore, names were carved on shells and rocks. With more than six million dead, memorials have evolved along the way. LONDON — Piece by piece, the Covid-19 sanctuary was born on a hilltop in the town of Bedworth in central England. The process was meant to be a metaphor for a human life. Like bones fused over time, it grew taller as the memorial’s creators spent months joining intricate pieces of wood into a skeletal structure that finally stood on its own, 65 feet high."
Rhode Island,2022,Q3,"Archaeologists found the remains of 14 soldiers who died in a pivotal Revolutionary War battle — a fresh reminder of the violence of war.

Rhode Island,2022,Q4,"The Texas Public Policy Foundation is shaping laws, running influence campaigns and taking legal action in a bid to promote fossil fuels. When a lawsuit was filed to block the nation’s first major offshore wind farm off the Massachusetts coast, it appeared to be a straightforward clash between those who earn their living from the sea and others who would install turbines and underwater cables that could interfere with the harvesting of squid, fluke and other fish."

Rhode Island,2022,Q4,"Democrats showed up, Trump-backed candidates underperformed and inflation wasn’t the whole story: Here are last night’s lessons.

Rhode Island,2022,Q4,Readers discuss if concealed carry training for educators is a viable option to protect schools from shootings. The text message was brief: “I’m hearing there is an active shooter near the school and the kids are on lockdown.”
Rhode Island,2022,Q4,"More than 10,000 told us about their ideal candidates. The midterm elections left neither Democrats nor Republicans with a clear advantage heading into the next presidential campaign season. Donald Trump just announced his candidacy, but that’s not stopping other Republicans from considering jumping in. President Biden says he will make a decision about a re-election bid early next year; some Democrats say they don’t want him to run again, but it’s hardly obvious who else would be a formidable Democratic Party nominee in 2024."
Rhode Island,2022,Q4,"As abortion access dwindles, America’s “parental involvement” laws weigh heavily on teenagers — who may need a court’s permission to end their pregnancies. On a hot Texas morning in 2020, Giselle, who goes by G, slipped her arms into a borrowed blazer, flipped up the nose ring in her septum so it couldn’t be seen and walked into the Coryell County Courthouse. It was the first time she had ever been to court. She was 17, 11 weeks pregnant and already beginning to show. She was going to ask a judge for authorization to seek an abortion. Her lawyer had explained that she needed to prove that she was mature enough to make this decision. G squeezed her lips around her braces, reminding herself not to smile. She didn’t want the judge to see her as a child."

That way, she could have her first sip the very moment her day began."
Rhode Island,2023,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage.

A majority of the Senate Democratic caucus called on President Biden on Wednesday to defend his request for $14.3 billion in emergency military assistance for Israel, seeking assurances that the Jewish state has a viable plan for defeating Hamas and that the United States will not be funding actions that run afoul of international and U.S. laws."
Rhode Island,2023,Q4,"After surrendering a homer that ended the Red Sox run in 2003, he played a critical role in the team’s World Series victory a year later.

Rhode Island,2024,Q1,"Nadya Tolokonnikova, a founding member of Pussy Riot, and John Caldwell have always prioritized being “helpful,” he said, over being happy. When Nadya Tolokonnikova, one of the founding members of the anti-establishment punk collective Pussy Riot, reached out to John Caldwell on Discord, an encrypted messaging app, he asked if she was a bot."
Rhode Island,2024,Q1,"We look at promising, evidence-based efforts to prevent suicide. “The bridge is sealed up.” Last month, with those words, the general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge announced the completion of a suicide barrier — stainless steel netting that extends about 20 feet out from the walkway for the length of the bridge, making a jump into the water below extraordinarily difficult."
Rhode Island,2024,Q1,"The case, to be argued by lawyers linked to the petrochemicals billionaire Charles Koch, could sharply curtail the government’s regulatory authority. Follow live updates for the Supreme Court’s decision on the Chevron doctrine."

I interviewed Chambers recently about his hopes and the magnitude of the challenge."
Rhode Island,2024,Q1,"President Biden has tried persuading Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu behind the scenes. But critics say it is time for a different approach.

Rhode Island,2024,Q2,"Homeowners in areas battered by climate disasters are facing dizzying insurance rate increases.

Rhode Island,2024,Q2,"A foundational 1984 decision had required courts to defer to agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes, underpinning regulations on health care, safety and the environment.

Rhode Island,2024,Q2,"He had opened two restaurants and a cocktail bar in downtown Manhattan, and he was preparing for a big expansion backed by LeBron James.

Rhode Island,2024,Q2,"Though the academic scene continues to imbue this coastal Connecticut city with a certain gravitas, surrounding neighborhoods are showing off their own cultural capital in the realms of art, food, music and more. The 75-foot-long brontosaurus at the newly reopened Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Conn., is the same dinosaur that the natural history museum has had on display since 1931. Yet it looks different. A fresh pose. New front ribs. The head is repositioned at a more inquisitive angle.

Rhode Island,2024,Q2,"There were more than 120 new arrests as universities moved to prevent pro-Palestinian encampments from taking hold as they have at Columbia University.

Rhode Island,2024,Q2,"There is a growing view that the U.S. business cycle has changed (for better) in a more diversified economy. To some, that sounds like tempting fate.

All three were connected to insiders at the nonprofit."
Rhode Island,2024,Q2,"The former national security adviser took over a nonprofit group. Soon, it was paying five of his relatives and trafficking in conspiracy theories. In 2021, retired Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Donald J. Trump’s first national security adviser, became chairman of a 75-year-old nonprofit organization — the kind of small charity where chairmen typically work for free."

Rhode Island,2024,Q3,"Methadone has been used for decades to treat opioid addiction. It is also difficult to come by, a problem health providers hope to ease with a new fleet of vans that can provide the drug. Before he started taking methadone, Vinny Parisi had overdosed 16 times from using street drugs, including fentanyl. Eating out of garbage cans and sleeping under a bridge in Harlem, he finally hit bottom, he said."
Rhode Island,2024,Q3,"The outbreak, linked to Boar’s Head products, has been especially devastating for high-risk groups like pregnant women and older adults. Ashley Solberg wasn’t worried about the risk to her pregnancy when she bought Boar’s Head sliced ham from a Florida supermarket in May. Her doctor had told her the risk was negligible, Ms. Solberg said, and she’d eaten deli meat without any issues in her last pregnancy. So she used it to make a poolside lunch for her parents and toddler."

Rhode Island,2024,Q3,"The president’s allies in the chamber he so revered feared he would drag them down and spoil his own legacy, and played a more assertive role than was previously known in his stepping aside.

Rhode Island,2024,Q3,"Every spring, hundreds of bicyclists gather in Santa Fe, N.M., to ride through a high-desert landscape rich in art, history and Indigenous culture. This year, the author, who lost the use of his legs 12 years ago, joined them. The nervous energy was palpable as hundreds of bike riders, shrink-wrapped in colorful Lycra outfits, waited for the start of the 50-mile Half-Century ride from the Santa Fe Railyard, a center for art galleries, restaurants and a weekly farmers’ market in Santa Fe, N.M.

Rhode Island,2024,Q3,"Chicky was beloved by her whole neighborhood. When she was killed by a speeding Jeep, we confronted a cold reality: Her death was considered a property crime. I had given up wanting a dog sometime around the age of 8 or 9, when I met the resistance of a fastidious mother, whose aversion to pet ownership flowed from her obsession with pristine surfaces. When my son came along — like me, an only child — it seemed cruel to deny him what I came to view as a nonoptional booster shot, a daily jolt of dog love that would supplement the parental variant, giving him another base of attachment in our tiny ecosystem of three. So when he turned 4, a Havanese puppy entered our lives as surely as a box of Duplos."
Rhode Island,2024,Q3,"Also, Donald Trump’s sentencing was delayed until September. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Like many other 81-year-old men, President Biden has sometimes mangled a sentence or mixed up a fact during his three and a half years in office.

Rhode Island,2024,Q3,"A former pop-singer, a YouTuber and a pioneering C.E.O. are among the select five given a special government designation. And they’re sharing advice for home cooks.
