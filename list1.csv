Alabama,2020,Q2,"Richard J. McGuire told the police that Discovery Island, an 11-acre zoological park with aromatic trees and walk-through aviaries that closed in 1999, looked like a “tropical paradise.” It had the makings of an adventure straight from Disney’s “Swiss Family Robinson” — being on an uninhabited island and living off the land."

Alabama,2020,Q2,"Inconsistent protocols, limited resources and a patchwork of decision making have led to an undercounting of people with the coronavirus who have died, health experts say.

Alabama,2020,Q3,"In four rulings in a row, the court has refused to ease voting restrictions. For the fourth time since April, the Supreme Court this week made it harder for Americans to vote. The ruling, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, was part of “a trend of condoning disfranchisement.”"
Alabama,2020,Q3,"Health experts have been skeptical that such parties occur, and details of this case could not be independently confirmed.

Alabama,2020,Q3,"Colleges are trying to isolate students who have the coronavirus or have been exposed to it, but they are running into a host of problems.

Health officials say an influx of rapid, inexpensive tests is good for the country, but caution that they are struggling to count those who test positive."
Alabama,2020,Q4,College athletics can teach the right lesson by insisting that public health is more important than sports.

Alabama,2021,Q1,"The immediate winner of college football’s national championship was easy to discern by the crowds after the game. The health consequences are yet to be seen.

WASHINGTON — President Biden on Thursday ordered the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplaces reopened to give people throttled by the pandemic economy a new chance to obtain coverage, and he took steps to restore coverage mandates that had been undermined by his predecessor, including protecting those with pre-existing medical conditions."

Alabama,2021,Q1,"With no nationwide plan for distributing coronavirus vaccines, people are scrambling to other states. Some health officials, saying greater immunity is the goal, aren’t standing in the way. When Chanel Maronge saw on Facebook that she was eligible to get a Covid-19 vaccine, she seized the opportunity. The only catch? She had to cross the state line to Mississippi last week, driving an hour and a half from her home in Baton Rouge, La., to get her first shot."
Alabama,2021,Q1,U.S. counties should prepare to overcome serious barriers to widespread vaccination. And vaccine hesitancy is only the tip of the iceberg. U.S. counties should prepare to overcome serious barriers to widespread vaccination. And vaccine hesitancy is only the tip of the iceberg.
Alabama,2021,Q2,"As they got to know each other better, Emily Capilouto and Dr. James Harb realized they had more similarities than differences.

WASHINGTON — Now that President Biden has met his goal to have all adults eligible for the coronavirus vaccine, health officials around the country are hitting what appears to be a soft ceiling: More than half the nation’s adults have received at least one dose, but it is going to take hard work — and some creative changes in strategy — to convince the rest."
Alabama,2021,Q2,"One in five in that age group, mostly in the South, haven’t received a single dose, increasing the risk of virus outbreaks there. There are 11 states in the United States where at least 20 percent of older adults still haven’t received a Covid shot, potentially putting the recovery there at risk."
Alabama,2021,Q2,A labor battle in Alabama is a referendum on Amazon’s strategy. It’s hard to decide who is having a better troll moment on Twitter this week: Jeff Bezos or Lil Nas X.
Alabama,2021,Q2,"Blues, silhouettes, two-dimensional figures at play. This artist created mystical experiences from whatever scraps he could find. Many of the works by the Alabama artist Bill Traylor, stark silhouette drawings with striking, significant blocks of color, are drawn on scraps of paper, or someone else’s stationery — things like that. This wasn’t Traylor’s way of making a postmodern statement; he was just using the art supplies he had."

Since March 2020, New York Times reporters have tracked every known coronavirus case in every correctional setting in the nation. More than 2,700 inmates have died."
Alabama,2021,Q2,"Efforts to speed up vaccinations have diverted resources from screening, and fewer people seem to seek out a test unless they are ill. Declines in coronavirus testing in many states in the South and the Great Plains are making it harder to know just how widely the virus may be spreading in those states, even as restrictions are lifted and residents ease back into daily life, experts say."
Alabama,2021,Q3,"Hospitalizations nationwide have increased by nearly 500 percent in the past two months, particularly across Southern states, where I.C.U. beds are filling up.

Alabama,2021,Q3,"At one time the N.F.L.’s highest-paid defensive player, he left the league after six seasons and fell into a spiral of addiction, homelessness and desolation. In N.F.L. parlance, Keith McCants was a “can’t miss.” A relentless and powerful athlete, he was a first-team all-American linebacker at Alabama and drafted fourth overall in 1990 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His success seemingly guaranteed, the team made him the highest-paid defensive player in the league."
Alabama,2021,Q3,"A second union vote may be held at an Alabama warehouse, and new tactics by the Teamsters and other groups aim to pressure Amazon across the country.

Vaccine uptake has risen from early-summer lows all over the United States, and the upswing is especially pronounced in places that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic’s fourth wave."
Alabama,2021,Q3,"It’s more than “hesitancy” that stops New Yorkers from getting vaccinated. Many communities have deep-seated doubts, and the Health Department is running out of ideas. If you were really scared of something — a fear founded on rumor and history, that you could get sick and possibly die, lose your ability to have children, alter your DNA or be left at the mercy of pernicious government surveillance — would you do it anyway, for the prospect of a membership to the Public Theater? Or a free glazed doughnut at Krispy Kreme?"
Alabama,2021,Q3,"The older cohort had a head start on getting immunized against Covid-19, but too many remain unprotected, experts say.

Alabama,2021,Q3,"The share of Hispanic people in the U.S. who reported receiving at least one dose of vaccine shot up from July to September, and now exceeds that of non-Hispanic white people.

Alabama,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit was filed a day after the announcement of a Jan. 4 deadline for the companies to begin their mandates or start weekly testing.

Alabama,2021,Q4,"The N.F.L. has very little wiggle room in its regular season and playoffs. And universities are reshuffling their college basketball teams as the College Football Playoff and bowl games near. The N.F.L. on Friday postponed three games that were slated for this weekend, the latest juggling of sports schedules as scores of college and professional athletes and coaches have tested positive for the coronavirus in the pandemic’s latest surge."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"Public health experts fear that the highly contagious variant cannot be stopped without harsh measures that the public will no longer tolerate.

Alabama,2021,Q4,"As many Americans plan larger celebrations this year, the immunization status of dinner guests is becoming a topic of conversation, concern and conflict. For the first time in two years, Tim Wyatt is hosting a Thanksgiving feast at his home in Birmingham, Ala. Along with the traditional turkey, Mr. Wyatt will spend days preparing his slow-roasted pork shoulder with Alabama white sauce. His wife, Nancy Wyatt, will cook all of her enticing side dishes, like sour cream mini-muffins and sweet potato casserole with sage butter."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"The number of eligible people still weighing whether to get a Covid vaccine has sharply dwindled, leaving an unvaccinated population that is mostly hard-core refusers. Vaccinated people have been burning up the phone lines at the community health center in rural Franklin, La., clamoring for the newly authorized Covid booster shot."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"Glimpses of a post-Roe world in Oklahoma.  Brittney Poolaw, then 19 years old, showed up at the Comanche County Memorial Hospital in Oklahoma last year after suffering a miscarriage at home. She had been about 17 weeks pregnant. According to an affidavit from a police detective who interviewed her, she admitted to hospital staff that she had recently used both methamphetamine and marijuana."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"Finger pointing is pointless, divisive and dumb.  Over the summer, as Covid cases started rising from their midyear lows, it became popular to blame Republicans for fueling the pandemic. The argument was that Covid had become a red-state scourge because of lower rates of mask-wearing and vaccination — along with high doses of vaccine misinformation — in places that went heavily for Donald Trump."

In the cities that were among the first to experience rapid rises in Covid cases due to Omicron, serious outcomes including I.C.U. stays and deaths are following case curves upward."
Alabama,2022,Q1,"The growing normalcy divide within liberal America. The line between zealous Covid precautions and a mask-optional existence does not run simply between red and blue America, between areas that voted for Joe Biden and those that voted for Donald Trump. As Park MacDougald pointed out in a recent essay for the online magazine UnHerd, if you’re a New York City resident, you can experience two completely different realities just by traveling the short distance from the posher parts of Brooklyn to where he lives in Queens — passing from a world of ubiquitous N95s and careful checking of vaccine cards to a world where masking is maybe a 50 percent proposition and, outside of hipster establishments, the vaccine-pass rules are “almost totally unenforced.”"
Alabama,2022,Q1,"We look at Omicron’s toll in New York and Seattle, two cities with timely data. Some of the timeliest data on Covid-19 outcomes by vaccination status comes from New York City and the Seattle area, and the two are telling a consistent story."

Alabama,2022,Q1,"The Supreme Court will hear from two convicted pill mill doctors in cases that could have significant implications for physicians’ latitude to prescribe addictive painkillers. For years, Dr. Xiulu Ruan was one of the nation’s top prescribers of quick-release fentanyl drugs. The medicines were approved only for severe breakthrough pain in cancer patients, but Dr. Ruan dispensed them almost exclusively for more common ailments: neck aches, back and joint pain. According to the Department of Justice, he and his partner wrote almost 300,000 prescriptions for controlled substances from 2011 to 2015, filled through the doctors’ own pharmacy in Mobile, Ala. Dr. Ruan often signed prescriptions without seeing patients, prosecutors said."

Alabama,2022,Q2,"Most of the state abortion prohibitions that would go into effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned do not contain carve-outs that were once widely supported by abortion opponents.

Alabama,2022,Q2,"I wrote the “Handbook for a Post-Roe America.” It’s time to put it into practice. In February 2021, I uprooted my husband, three children and two cats from our longtime home to move across the country to a house we had only seen on FaceTime, in a city we only knew from college football. I did this because I believe that everyone who supports abortion rights must do what they’re able to to keep abortion accessible for those who have the least resources to get one."

WASHINGTON — Billions of dollars in emergency aid to war-torn Ukraine and communities ravaged by natural disasters.

The Times reported last month that drug shortages in the United States are approaching record levels, with thousands of patients facing delays in getting cancer treatments, a drug that reverses lead poisoning, a sterile fluid needed to stop the heart for bypass surgery and antibiotics for strep throat, among many other medicines. One doctor described the shortages as a national health emergency."
Alabama,2023,Q2,"“Say Anarcha” is J.C. Hallman’s meticulous biography of the enslaved woman who suffered unimaginable horrors at the hands of a lauded doctor. Medical journals are filled with untold stories. We may be able to imagine a moment — the pain of a biopsy, the devastation of a cancer recurrence. But in a research paper, these experiences are necessarily reduced, by the scientific method and privacy concerns, to numbers. Responders and non-responders. Recurrence and no recurrence. Mortality and survival. Rarely, one name leaps at us from the medical literature and demands a personal reckoning. And one such name is Anarcha."
Alabama,2023,Q2,"Using journals left behind by his idol and mentor, Daniel Wallace tries to make sense of the inexplicable. Daniel Wallace’s new book, “This Isn’t Going to End Well,” is a eulogy, a cautionary tale, a love letter and a sob of anger."

Alabama,2023,Q3,"Algorithmic recommendations aren’t just bad for kids’ mental health; they’re taking away the journey of discovery that comes with being human. Kids are even more in the bag of social media companies than we think.

Alabama,2023,Q3,"President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate some drug prices, a change that the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have opposed for decades. As he heads toward a re-election campaign next year, President Biden is betting that his success in pushing for policies intended to lower health care costs for millions of Americans will be rewarded by voters at the ballot box."

Alabama,2023,Q4,"Mississippi has long had high childhood immunization rates, but a federal judge has ordered the state to allow parents to opt out on religious grounds. For more than 40 years, Mississippi had one of the strictest school vaccination requirements in the nation, and its high childhood immunization rates have been a source of pride. But in July, the state began excusing children from vaccination if their parents cited religious objections, after a federal judge sided with a “medical freedom” group."

Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate, held in Tuscaloosa, Ala., will feature just four candidates — Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and Chris Christie — sparring over everything from abortion to Israel to former President Donald Trump. When we asked Times Opinion columnists and contributors what they would ask the candidates if they were moderating the debate, they came back to us with questions designed to test them on guns and crime, foreign wars and health care — exposing where the field stands on, say, military aid for Ukraine or a draconian state abortion ban. But above all, what they wanted to see was the moderators needling the candidates into taking a strong stance on the former president. Here are the responses:"
Alabama,2023,Q4,"A child psychologist, he argued that behavioral therapy had to come first in addressing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, with drugs like Ritalin as a supplement. William E.

Alaska,2020,Q1,"In a health care system that is already difficult to navigate, some patients describe Kafkaesque quests for tests. BOSTON — First came the tickle in the throat. Then, a hacking cough.

Sometime very soon, one hopes, the Biden administration will attempt to explain to the American people what they think our fighters shot down over Lake Huron and northern Canada and off Alaska, be they balloons or drones or something somewhat stranger. If that happens, we will take a meaningful step toward solving a longstanding, conspiracy-shadowed mystery: What, exactly, are all the unidentified flying objects — sorry, sorry — unidentified aerial phenomena that our military keeps encountering in the skyfields above planet Earth?"
Alaska,2023,Q1,"The man, Tyler W. Massengill, 32, told investigators that he hoped the fire on Jan. 15 would delay others in having an abortion, according to federal authorities. A man accused of firebombing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Peoria, Ill., earlier this month told investigators that he had done so after recalling an abortion a former girlfriend once had against his wishes, adding that he hoped the fire would delay others in having abortions, according to federal authorities."
Alaska,2023,Q1,"Scientists say that reintroducing the fast-moving predators to the West Coast could help control the spread of sea urchins that are devouring kelp. The kelp forests off the West Coast are dying, and with their decline, an entire ecosystem of marine plants and animals is at risk. A large starfish with an appetite for sea urchins could come to the rescue."
Alaska,2023,Q1,"The chain’s situation shows the complicated legal and reputational landscape that it and its competitors must navigate in the post-Roe era. Walgreens landed at the center of a consumer and political firestorm in recent days, after saying it would not dispense an abortion pill in 21 states where Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action against pharmacies that try to distribute the medication."

Alaska,2023,Q1,"A major strike on Russian troops. In a deadly attack on New Year’s Day, Ukrainians used American-made long-range HIMARS rockets to kill dozens — and perhaps hundreds — of Moscow’s troops in the occupied city of Makiivka, in eastern Ukraine.

Alaska,2023,Q1,"Many of the legal arguments seeking to overturn abortion bans rely on rights provided by the states, and how they are interpreted by state supreme courts. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in June, it declared that it was sending the issue back to the “people and their elected representatives.” But the fight has largely moved to a different set of supreme courts and constitutions: those in the states."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"After nearly 30 years in elected office, Washington’s governor plans to shift his focus to climate solutions and clean energy, underscoring the need for “a sense of optimism and confidence.” Jay Inslee has been in elected office so long that he served in Congress during the tail end of the George H.W. Bush administration."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"Scientists say alarming declines at the southern end of the fishes’ range may be a sign of what’s to come as waters warm farther north. This week, officials are expected to shut down all commercial and recreational salmon fishing off California for 2023. Much will be canceled off neighboring Oregon, too."

Alaska,2023,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"When coverage upsets them, towns and counties are revoking newspapers’ lucrative contracts to print public notices. Two of the most powerful women in the village of Delhi in central New York sat face to face in a brick building on Main Street for what would become a fight over the First Amendment."

Alaska,2023,Q2,"San Francisco has proposed the nation’s most ambitious reparations plan, including $5 million cash payments and housing aid that aims to bring people back. SAN FRANCISCO — Standing at the stoop of her childhood home — a slim but stately Victorian shaded by an evergreen pear tree — Lynette Mackey pulled up a photo of a family gathering from nearly 50 years ago. The men were all in suits, the women in skirts. Ms. Mackey, a teenager in red bell bottoms, stretched her arms wide and had a beaming smile."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"The former prosecutor was chosen for his experience in bringing high-stakes cases against politicians in the United States and abroad. Jack Smith, appointed in November to investigate former President Donald J. Trump, is a hard-driving, flinty veteran Justice Department prosecutor chosen for his experience in bringing high-stakes cases against politicians in the United States and abroad."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"Senator Joe Manchin III, the conservative West Virginia Democrat who faces re-election next year and is flirting with a presidential run, has threatened to repeal the measure he helped write. Ever since Senator Joe Manchin III, the conservative West Virginia Democrat, cast the crucial vote last year for the Inflation Reduction Act, delivering President Biden his biggest legislative victory to date, the bill has weighed him down politically."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"It’s the last in a string of major regulations proposed by the Biden administration to sharply cut the greenhouse gases produced by the United States. The Biden administration on Thursday announced the first regulations to limit greenhouse pollution from existing power plants, capping an unparalleled string of climate policies that, taken together, could substantially reduce the nation’s contribution to global warming."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"Avian species are “especially vulnerable,” scientists say. The Maui wildfires are an ongoing human tragedy. At least 111 people have died, more than 1,000 people are unaccounted for, and many have been displaced from their homes."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"Thirty years of progress in decreasing drowning deaths in the United States appears to have plateaued, and disparities in deaths among some racial groups have worsened. Yadira Salcedo was born in Mexico to parents who did not know how to swim. As a child, she nearly drowned when she waded too deep in a backyard pool."
Alaska,2023,Q3,59 percent of voters sided with young activists in a referendum. Ecuador voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to halt oil drilling in one of the most biodiverse places on earth.
Alaska,2023,Q3,"The directive is intended to embed the cost of climate change into all federal agencies. But it is not legally binding and could come with legal and logistical challenges. A directive issued on Thursday by the Biden administration would, for the first time, have federal agencies consider the economic damage caused by climate change when deciding what kinds of vehicles, equipment and goods to buy."

Alaska,2023,Q3,"Senator Chuck Schumer’s move to clear the way for the confirmation of three top generals left unanswered the question of what would happen to hundreds of other military promotions. The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly confirmed Gen. Randy George of the Army and Gen. Eric Smith of the Marines as the chiefs of staff of their respective services, circumventing a single senator’s blockade against senior military promotions but leaving hundreds more still in limbo."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, after the Supreme Court’s ruling. After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year, it looked like the number of abortions would soon plummet across the country. But new estimates suggest that has not happened. The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, nationwide since 2020, our colleagues Amy Schoenfeld Walker and Allison McCann reported today."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"The increase in poverty reversed two years of large declines. Median income, adjusted for inflation, fell 2.3 percent to $74,580. Poverty increased sharply last year in the United States, particularly among children, as living costs rose and federal programs that provided aid to families during the pandemic were allowed to expire."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"Do we own our bodies? The answer, according to many legal experts, is no. Do we own our bodies? To an ordinary person, the answer is obviously yes. To a lawyer, it’s not at all clear. That discrepancy needs to be resolved."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"New vaccines for older adults and pregnant women, and an antibody therapy for infants, provide options for preventing severe infection. Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading reason for hospitalization among infants in the United States. Between 58,000 and 80,000 children under the age of five, the majority of whom are less than a year old, are hospitalized for it every year."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"Observations from researchers and residents, published annually in a report by NOAA, reveal a region grappling with rapid change.

The Senate confirmed nearly a dozen military officers to four-star positions on Tuesday, ending Senator Tommy Tuberville’s nearly yearlong blockade of promotions for senior generals and admirals."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"There are two Americas, and they are divided by a college degree. By many measures, the U.S. economy is thriving: Unemployment stands close to the 50-year low set in April, the fraction of people age 25 to 54 in work is at a two-decade high, gross domestic product is growing rapidly, inflation is falling, and the S&P 500 is a third higher than it was before the Covid pandemic."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"Meatless menus used to be an oddity in Germany’s capital. Today, Berlin is bursting with creative vegan options, including Spanish tapas, Berliner-style doughnuts and even fast food. When Tran Mai Huy Thong was growing up as a vegetarian in West Germany, his peers couldn’t comprehend his choice to not eat meat."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage. For 35 years, Angela Jemmott and her five brothers paid premiums on a long-term care insurance policy for their 91-year-old mother. But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"The president’s strategic options for 2024. With President Biden having fallen behind Donald Trump in the early 2024 polls, Trump’s strategy seems fairly straightforward: more of the same. Trump will portray Biden as old, inflation as high, immigration as out of control and the nation as weak. All these arguments play into the concerns of many voters."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"President Biden campaigned on stopping construction of the border wall, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and ending the death penalty. As President Biden campaigns for re-election, Democrats have heralded a series of accomplishments under his tenure. At times, Mr. Biden has called attention to promises by his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, that fell short."

Arizona,2020,Q1,"People leaving the Golden State are changing the political makeup of the states they move to. President Trump clearly hates the most populous state in the country he governs. While trashing California with his gutter mouth, the president has used his office to physically trash the home to nearly one in eight Americans — seeking to make its air more polluted, its water less clean, its forests more vulnerable to catastrophic fires."
Arizona,2020,Q1,"With a broad coalition, Joseph R. Biden Jr. defeated Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, in a rout that could add to pressure on Mr. Sanders to end his campaign.

Arizona,2020,Q2,"Republicans and the Trump administration continue to press to end the Affordable Care Act even as the virus leaves more Americans worried about affordable health coverage.

Arizona,2020,Q2,"As state and local governments confront a new wave of coronavirus infections, President Trump is sending mixed messages and Washington’s public health bully pulpit has gone silent. WASHINGTON — The federal government’s leadership in the coronavirus crisis has so faded that state and local health officials have been left to figure out on their own how to handle rising infections and to navigate conflicting signals from the White House."
Arizona,2020,Q2,"The lack of virus protocols as July’s camps approach has left many in football unsure about safety in a sport that requires contact on nearly every play and cramped quarters inside team facilities. In this most unusual off-season roiled by the coronavirus pandemic, the N.F.L. has adapted by conducting business (mostly) as usual. Free agency, the college draft, rookie camp and voluntary workouts were all held on time, albeit remotely instead of in person."

Arizona,2020,Q2,The president went to Phoenix to speak to a group of student supporters.

Arizona,2020,Q2,"No other developed country is doing so badly. Graphs of the coronavirus curves in Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy look like mountains, with steep climbs up and then back down.

Now, according to The Times, it’s up a terrifying 22 percent over the last 14 days."

Arizona,2021,Q2,"The pandemic barely dented the financial outlook for some major networks, which continued to acquire weaker hospitals and ailing doctors’ practices. Critics worry consolidation leads to higher prices for medical care. Billions of dollars in Covid aid cushioned financial losses caused by the pandemic at some of the nation’s largest hospital chains. But those bailouts also helped sustain the big chains’ spending sprees as they expanded even more by scooping up weakened competitors and doctors’ practices."

Arizona,2021,Q3,"As students prepare for a return to in-person learning, conflicts have arisen in several U.S. states over mask mandates in schools. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is looming large over this year’s back-to-school preparations in the United States."
Arizona,2021,Q3,"University of Texas at San Antonio will begin with mostly remote classes, because of the city’s high infection rates. Other schools are trying to avoid that fate. It is what many universities fear. After months of gearing up for a fall semester that seemed like normal, with in-person classes and packed football games, the University of Texas at San Antonio announced Wednesday that almost all courses will be held online for the first three weeks."
Arizona,2021,Q3,"New funding will allow more medical appointments to take place via video in rural communities, where some of the nation’s oldest and sickest patients live. The roughly 15 percent of the population living in rural America includes some of the oldest and sickest patients in the country — a disparity that has grown more stark during the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administration is investing more in telemedicine, whose use has grown sharply during the pandemic, as a way to improve their access to care."
Arizona,2021,Q3,"A top White House adviser said monoclonal antibody treatments, sometimes underused, could still be crucial in helping people with Covid-19 avoid getting very sick. WASHINGTON — Facing overcrowded hospitals and an unrelenting surge of Delta variant cases around the country, the Biden administration on Thursday renewed its call for health providers to use monoclonal antibody treatments, which can help Covid-19 patients who are at risk of getting very sick."

Arizona,2021,Q3,"The announcement from Mayor Muriel Bowser came as some states and municipalities were quick to adopt the new C.D.C. guidelines while others expressed outrage. Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said on Thursday that an indoor mask mandate would be reimposed in the nation’s capital on Saturday, becoming the latest jurisdiction to change public health protocols after new federal guidance advised even vaccinated people in coronavirus hot spots to resume wearing face coverings in indoor public spaces."
Arizona,2021,Q3,"Many testing sites were closed or scaled back after vaccines became available, but the latest surge of infections and new mandates have increased the need for testing. As the Delta variant of the coronavirus spreads in the United States, some counties are reopening community testing sites that they shuttered last spring, when case counts were falling and attention was shifting to vaccination."
Arizona,2021,Q3,"As publisher, Ms. Litrell focused not on telling woman what to wear or how to cook, but on how to integrate into the work force. Barbara J. Litrell, a publisher of women’s magazines that focused not on hair and makeup but on the contributions women made to the work force, died on July 4 at her home in Cottonwood, Ariz. She was 77."
Arizona,2021,Q3,"If confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Rahul Gupta would become the first medical doctor to serve in the position since the role was created in 1988. WASHINGTON — President Biden intends to nominate Dr. Rahul Gupta, who led West Virginia’s response to a devastating opioid crisis, to run the Office of National Drug Control Policy — a choice that immediately drew mixed reviews from advocates for people with substance abuse problems."

Arizona,2021,Q4,"The furious members accused the Arizona Democrat of “answering to big donors rather than your own people,” in the latest sign of the political pressure she faces. WASHINGTON — Five veterans tapped to advise Senator Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, resigned from their posts on Thursday, publicly accusing her of “hanging your constituents out to dry” in the latest sign of growing hostility toward a centrist who has emerged as a key holdout on President Biden’s agenda."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"There’s a difference between being a maverick and being a narcissist. In 2003, Joe Lieberman, at the time one of the worst Democratic senators, traveled to Arizona to campaign for his party’s presidential nomination and was regularly greeted by antiwar demonstrators. “He’s a shame to Democrats,” said the organizer of a protest outside a Tucson hotel, a left-wing social worker named Kyrsten Sinema. “I don’t even know why he’s running. He seems to want to get Republicans voting for him — what kind of strategy is that?”"
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Public health in crisis At the beginning of the summer, when it looked like the U.S. was turning the corner on the pandemic, my colleagues Danielle Ivory and Mike Baker set out to answer a question: How prepared are local and state health departments for the next pandemic?"
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Most of the results of rapid tests are not reported. That’s magnifying questions about how best to measure the spread of the virus. Millions of rapid at-home Covid tests are flying off pharmacy shelves across the country, giving Americans an instant, if sometimes imperfect, read on whether they are infected with the coronavirus."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Cases are shooting up, I.C.U.s are stretched thin and booster vaccinations are lagging. Signs point to an intense winter wave in the United States.

Arizona,2021,Q4,"Experts and tribal leaders aren’t sure why, but living near communities with low vaccination rates may be contributing. The Navajo Nation managed to tame Covid-19 earlier this year, mounting a campaign that drove its vaccination rate far above the United States average, after the virus ravaged the Navajo people."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"The party’s struggles in communities that saw declines in manufacturing and union jobs, and health care, could more than offset its gains in metropolitan areas. WASHINGTON — The share of the Democratic presidential vote in the Midwest declined most precipitously between 2012 and 2020 in counties that experienced the steepest losses in manufacturing and union jobs and saw declines in health care, according to a new report to be released this month."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Public health experts fear that the highly contagious variant cannot be stopped without harsh measures that the public will no longer tolerate.

Arizona,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit was filed a day after the announcement of a Jan. 4 deadline for the companies to begin their mandates or start weekly testing. The attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday in an effort to prevent the Biden administration from requiring large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations, the latest sign of growing pushback against the federal government’s biggest effort yet to enlist private businesses in combating the virus."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"The U.S. is one of six countries with no national paid leave. The Democrats have cut their plan to four weeks, which would still make it an outlier. Congress is now considering four weeks of paid family and medical leave, down from the 12 weeks that were initially proposed in the Democrats’ spending plan. If the plan becomes law, the United States will no longer be one of six countries in the world — and the only rich country — without any form of national paid leave."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"Two performances, so far, are being rescheduled, his tour said, after an outbreak “within the team.” The singer Justin Bieber has tested positive for the coronavirus, one day after he began his world tour in San Diego on Friday, a representative for Mr. Bieber confirmed on Sunday."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"The study found that districts with full mask requirements had 23 percent lower rates of the coronavirus among students and staff members than districts without the mandates. More and more American school districts have dropped mask mandates in recent weeks as coronavirus cases plunged across the United States. But they remain a subject of debate among some students and their parents, and a study released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that those mandates had helped protect children and teachers from the coronavirus last fall."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"People who worked out in even moderately polluted air did not show the kinds of brain improvements tied to a lower risk of dementia. Work out in polluted air and you may miss out on some of the brain benefits of exercise, according to two, large-scale new studies of exercise, air quality and brain health. The studies, which involved tens of thousands of British men and women, found that, most of the time, people who ran and rode vigorously had larger brain volumes and lower risks for dementia than their less active peers. But if people exercised in areas with even moderate levels of air pollution, the expected brain improvements from exercise almost disappeared."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"Some scientists and health experts see the possibility that the first signs of a new surge could be missed, but others say metrics like hospitalizations and wastewater monitoring have become more relevant than daily reports. A growing number of U.S. states have stopped giving daily updates of the number of new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths, which, combined with the rise of at-home testing whose results are often not officially registered, is creating a more uneven real-time look at the state of the pandemic."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"Most everyone agrees the unbranded animals are a problem in Gila National Forest. But fear that the federal plan involves shooting them from a helicopter has led to sharp local opposition. Hundreds of feral cattle roam freely in Gila National Forest, more than three million acres of remote and sprawling land in New Mexico with mountains, hot springs and untouched federally designated wilderness areas."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"President Biden announced that his administration would double its order of Pfizer’s scarce Covid-19 antiviral drug, which has been shown to reduce hospitalizations. WASHINGTON — The United States government doubled its order for Pfizer’s Covid pills on Tuesday, a move that will modestly increase the nation’s very limited supply of the treatment in the short term amid a record-setting surge in coronavirus cases."
Arizona,2022,Q1,The powerful political action committee said the Arizona senator could find herself “standing alone” in 2024 if she refuses to change Senate rules to force through voting rights legislation.

Arizona,2022,Q1,"It never quite fit in your wallet, so it’s no surprise you may have misplaced it by now. More than a year ago, when Covid-19 vaccines became available and jabs started going into arms, it became a point of pride for some people to show off a bandaged shoulder and a white Covid-19 Vaccination Record card."

SAN TAN VALLEY, Ariz. — Buffeted by rising costs and declining interest from golfers, the Links at Queen Creek course closed two years ago after 26 years of operation. But with the demand for housing in Arizona soaring, Walt Brown Jr. saw a different fate for the 106-acre parcel of grass and palm trees southeast of Phoenix."

Arizona,2022,Q2,"Far-right activists are intercepting migrant children and collecting information about their families, based on a conspiracy theory that they are falling prey to sex-trafficking rings. SASABE, Ariz. — The 15 migrant children, weary and hungry, stumbled toward a gap in the rust-colored border wall that soars between Mexico and Arizona, nearing the end of their two-week trek north. Unexpectedly, a man in a cap emblazoned with a blackened American flag — traditionally, a message that “no quarter” will be given to the enemy — approached them and coaxed them to his campsite."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"Record-breaking heat will continue through the weekend from California to South Texas. Meteorologists say the soaring temperatures may cause illness. Dangerous and potentially deadly heat will settle over the southwestern United States through much of the weekend, with temperatures in some locations expected to break records and exceed 100 degrees."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"People from around the world have been lingering on the border, awaiting the end of pandemic restrictions. Their fate remains one of the Biden administration’s biggest challenges on immigration. NOGALES, Mexico — Guadalupe Garcia crossed the border into Arizona with her 11-year-old daughter early this year, saying she was fleeing the brutal beatings she was suffering at the hands of her husband in Guatemala. The Border Patrol informed her that the United States was not open for asylum, and quickly put the pair on a bus back to Mexico."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"Under the ruling, the public health measure known as Title 42 that has denied migrants entry will remain in effect. A federal judge on Friday blocked the Biden administration from lifting a pandemic-related health order whose scheduled expiration on Monday would have thrown open the doors of the United States to asylum seekers at the border for the first time in more than two years."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"A survey by election researchers argues that efforts to confuse or scare away prospective voters disproportionately target minority groups in battleground states. When it comes to elections, disinformation is not just a problem online."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"The ban, passed by Republican lawmakers and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, is scheduled to take effect on Friday. MIAMI — In a welcome but likely brief victory for supporters of abortion rights, a judge in Florida blocked a state law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy on Thursday, the latest in a flurry of activity in state courts and legislatures following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"In an unusual step, the mother of Lee Michael Pahe, who was found dead in July 2021, made a plea on the radio in her language, seeking information about her son’s death. The F.B.I. started airing a radio ad last week seeking information about the fatal shooting of a man in Naschitti, N.M., within the Navajo Nation."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"Amid pandemic stress and racial violence, many communities of color have turned to wilderness areas for healing. For Cynthia Philips, it was the sound of bees, willows, crickets and the hum of a metallic Tibetan bowl that helped her overcome some of her anxieties."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The passage of the bill, which appeared dead just weeks ago, caps a Democratic effort to deliver on major components of President Biden’s agenda. WASHINGTON — Congress gave final approval on Friday to legislation that would reduce the cost of prescription drugs and pour billions of dollars into the effort to slow global warming, as House Democrats overcame united Republican opposition to deliver on key components of President Biden’s domestic agenda."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The bill is the latest victory for the president on overhauling the physical economy, but he has found less support for plans to help workers. WASHINGTON — President Biden signed into law a landmark tax, health and energy bill on Tuesday that takes significant steps toward fulfilling his goal to modernize the American economy and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The bill includes billions in tax credits for the production of renewable energy, drug-pricing reforms and a boost for the I.R.S. WASHINGTON — After months of painstaking negotiations, Democrats are set to push through a climate, tax and health care package that would salvage key elements of President Biden’s domestic agenda."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The vote was a major victory for President Biden and Democrats, who are battling to maintain their slim House and Senate majorities in November’s midterm congressional elections. WASHINGTON — The Senate passed legislation on Sunday that would make the most significant federal investment in history to counter climate change and lower the cost of prescription drugs, as Democrats banded together to push through major pieces of President Biden’s domestic agenda over unified Republican opposition."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"New federal data outline the scale of suffering among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Carol Schumacher, 56, who was raised in the remote community of Chilchinbeto in the Navajo Nation, has lost 42 family members to Covid-19 over the last two years. The dead included two brothers aged 55 and 54, and cousins as young as 18 and 19."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The Opinion podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro explored the future of reproductive health care in a virtual event. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, medical providers were faced with a complex patchwork of state-level abortion bans and prohibitions. In Arizona, medical workers wondered if a century-old law banning almost all abortions and punishing providers with prison time meant that they should stop the procedures. In Wisconsin, a district attorney said he would not prosecute abortion cases after an 1849 state law banning them took effect."

Arizona,2022,Q4,"Even as voting goes smoothly, the 2022 midterm elections have exposed the toll Donald J. Trump’s falsehoods have taken on American democracy. Voters go to the polls on Tuesday after a campaign season so filled with conspiracy theories and lies that officials worry they will undermine confidence in the election no matter how the balloting goes."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"The measure, if signed by the president, would not affect the northern region of the country along the U.S. border. Mexico’s Senate voted on Wednesday to end daylight saving time for most of the country, signaling a preference for more daylight in the mornings and potentially ending a biannual turning of the clocks."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"While many physicians may avoid discussing the subject, a study showed that who gets addressed with the honorific “Dr.” may depend on gender, degree and specialty. Dr. Yul Yang, a dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., addresses all of his patients with an honorific — Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. — even if they ask him to use their first names. It is a sign of respect and a way of distinguishing his professional role as a doctor from a more personal role as a friend or confidant. But many patients do not reciprocate, calling him Yul instead of Dr. Yang."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Could the disease be back? The doctor’s voice over the phone was warm and reassuring. The patient, a 62-year-old man, had a chest CT earlier that day, and Dr. David Smith, his longtime P.C.P., was telling him that the radiologist saw a mass. It sounded bad, but it probably wasn’t cancer, Smith told him. “I didn’t want you to see the report and worry,” he added. The report said that the mass in his lungs looked like a neoplasm — the fancy word for tumor. But it went on to acknowledge that it could also just be left over from the really bad pneumonia the man had three months earlier."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"All of my years as an organizer have taught me to channel that anger into action, and that in itself is a discipline of hope. Imagine what it’s like to live in a state of perpetual uncertainty — at any moment you could lose your job because you no longer have the right to work legally. Picture families ripped apart — a mother sent back to a country she barely remembers, forced to leave her child behind. What would you do if the teachers, doctors and nurses in your community were suddenly barred from entering your children’s classrooms or treating your loved ones?"
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Cook County, Ill., and Toledo, Ohio, are turning to the American Rescue Plan to wipe out residents’ medical debt. Experts caution it is a short-term solution. In the next few weeks, tens of thousands of people in Cook County, Ill., will open their mailboxes to find a letter from the county government explaining that their medical debt has been paid off."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Policies in some states are also hurting efforts to keep children safe. Twenty-three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States. Last month, the C.D.C. joined with the World Health Organization to warn that the disease, which vaccines can prevent, had become “an imminent threat in every region in the world.”"
Arizona,2022,Q4,"A precariously narrow but consequential slice of the electorate broke with its own voting history to reject openly extremist Republican candidates — at least partly out of concern for the health of the political system. Not long ago, Joe Mohler would have seemed an unlikely person to help bury the political legacy of Donald J. Trump."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Americans over 65 remain the demographic most likely to have received the original series of vaccinations. But fewer are getting the follow-up shots, surveys indicate. Linda Brantman, a retired membership salesperson at a health club in Chicago, was paying attention last month when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the new bivalent booster that protects against two variants of Covid-19. She went online and reserved an appointment at a Walgreens near her home."

Arizona,2023,Q1,"Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania opened 92 percent of state government jobs to people without four-year degrees. Gov. Jim Pillen of Nebraska created a state office focused on broadband access. After a midterm election year in which statewide races were almost entirely wrapped up in national issues — abortion and democracy — the nation’s newly elected governors are showing their ambitions with a mix of virtue-signaling on national issues, currying favor with their political bases and, for some, reaching out to broader constituencies."
Arizona,2023,Q1,The Canadian Medical Association is pushing for a single license to eliminate the barriers between provinces and territories.

Arizona,2023,Q1,"A 2011 mass shooting left Gabrielle Giffords, then a Democratic congresswoman, partly paralyzed and unable to speak fluently. She has since built a powerful advocacy group. WASHINGTON — Twelve years after a bullet ripped through the left side of her brain, Gabrielle Giffords speaks mainly in stock phrases and short bursts, conveying meaning with her eyes or a boxer’s swing of her left arm, the one that is still fully mobile. “Enough is enough!” she might say. Or: “Be passionate! Be courageous!”"
Arizona,2023,Q1,"Genetic research from China suggests to some experts that the coronavirus may have sprung from a seafood market in Wuhan. Now the data are missing from a scientific database. The World Health Organization rebuked Chinese officials on Friday for withholding research that may link Covid’s origin to wild animals, asking why the data had not been made available three years ago and why it is now missing.Before the Chinese data disappeared, an international team of virus experts downloaded and began analyzing the research, which appeared online in January. They say it supports the idea that the pandemic could have begun when illegally traded raccoon dogs infected humans at a Wuhan seafood market."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Business groups are critical of the candidate, Julie Su, and key senators are wavering. The administration’s labor policies are central to the clash. Just over a year ago, the White House suffered an embarrassing defeat when three Democratic senators voted against advancing President Biden’s pick to run a key labor agency, dealing a blow to the administration’s pro-labor agenda."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Some are taking sick days. Others are cutting back their hours. Still others end up quitting altogether. Menopause costs American women an estimated $1.8 billion in lost working time per year, according to a Mayo Clinic study published this week. The paper examined how hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and the myriad other symptoms associated with this time of life affect women in the workplace. It’s the largest study of its kind to have been done in the United States."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Temperatures will be up to 20 degrees above normal for much of the region through at least the weekend, with no nighttime relief. Even for Southerners used to spending a lot of time outside, this week’s brutal heat and humidity — which spread from Texas across the Gulf Coast and north into Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas on Wednesday — are a little much."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"New York Times photographers are documenting the experience on both sides of the border, from Tijuana on the West Coast to Matamoros near the Gulf of Mexico. Despite concerns that the end of a public health measure known as Title 42 would bring chaos to the southern U.S. border, there were few signs of disorder on Friday in the hours after the measure expired. Yet many migrants have crossed to apply for asylum, and thousands are still being detained in Border Patrol holding facilities, awaiting processing. "

After the House passed legislation to suspend the debt ceiling and limit federal spending last night, the bill moved to the Senate for approval.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In a closet-sized windowless office, Kialah Marshall maintains an Excel spreadsheet with a prosaic title, “Medicaid Unwinding,” the source material for a mind-numbing routine."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"As states begin to drop people from their Medicaid programs, early data shows that many recipients are losing their coverage for procedural reasons. Hundreds of thousands of low-income Americans have lost Medicaid coverage in recent weeks as part of a sprawling unwinding of a pandemic-era policy that prohibited states from removing people from the program."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"Amid an uptick in Covid infections, administrators, staff and patients are divided over the need for masks in health care settings.

Each morning, Rickquita Monroe, 34, and Curby Monroe, 32, wake up beneath an overpass in downtown Orlando, Fla. Several other people are usually spread out beside them on the sidewalks lining either side of the five-lane road. Throughout the night, they count on gusts of wind from passing traffic for relief from the thick, increasingly blistering Florida heat. It is especially dangerous to Ms. Monroe, who has a seizure disorder that is exacerbated by high temperatures."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"Hospitalizations are still low but have been rising in recent weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Arizona,2023,Q4,"More than 60 years ago, America was confronted with the story of a young woman forced to seek an abortion abroad after unwittingly taking a drug that caused severe birth defects. Much of the country no doubt watched in amazement last week as a woman with a doomed pregnancy was forced to flee her home state, Texas, to get the abortion her doctors deemed necessary to protect her future ability to bear children. Could this really be happening in the United States in 2023?"

Arkansas,2020,Q1,"Breakthrough treatments for lung cancer and melanoma have driven down cancer mortality overall — and from 2016 to 2017 spurred the largest-ever decline. The cancer death rate in the United States fell 2.2 percent from 2016 to 2017 — the largest single-year decline in cancer mortality ever reported, the American Cancer Society reported on Wednesday. Since 1991 the rate has dropped 29 percent, which translates to approximately 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if the mortality rate had remained constant. "

CLINTON, Ark. — After a brief shutdown to hinder the coronavirus’s spread, Arkansas began opening up, slowly and cautiously, on May 11. Businesses are placing limits on the number of customers they will serve at any one time, and social distancing and mask wearing is still required in establishments like restaurants. The state’s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, has been critical of businesses and customers that don’t follow these rules. Even so, Arkansas has seen a second peak of coronavirus infection, as cases surge especially among younger people and the Latino population in northwestern counties. On Thursday, Governor Hutchinson announced the largest single-day increase in community transmission — 261 cases."

Arkansas,2020,Q2,"The current civil unrest is deeply connected to the racial disparities exposed by the coronavirus crisis. “I’m just as likely to die from a cop as I am from Covid,” one organizer said. WASHINGTON — When Mike Griffin, a black community organizer in Minneapolis, took to the streets in protest, he was grieving for two black men taken during the turmoil convulsing the country: George Floyd, who died after gasping for air under the knee of a white police officer, and his own godfather, who succumbed to Covid-19."

White-tailed deer on Staten Island have been found carrying the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus, marking the first time the variant has been reported in wild animals."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"The Biden administration said federal masking guidance would not change for now, but was seeking advice from public health experts on the way forward. WASHINGTON — The White House has been meeting with outside health experts to plan a pandemic exit strategy and a transition to a “new normal,” but the behind-the-scenes effort is crashing into a very public reality: A string of blue-state governors have gotten ahead of President Biden by suddenly abandoning their mask mandates."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"The overall pattern is familiar, but a fresh perspective on how to interpret cases, hospitalizations and deaths is necessary as Omicron tears through the country. The overall pattern is familiar, but a fresh perspective on how to interpret cases, hospitalizations and deaths is necessary as Omicron tears through the country."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"Reports of infections are falling in Cleveland, Newark and Washington, suggesting that a national peak may be approaching. At another bleak moment of the pandemic in the United States — with nearly 800,000 new cases a day, deaths rising and federal medical teams deploying to overwhelmed hospitals — glints of progress have finally started to emerge. In a handful of places that were among the first to see a surge of the Omicron variant last month, reports of new coronavirus infections have started to level off or decline."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"The physical toll on Mayfield, Ky., is evident. The psychological anguish will be equally difficult to overcome. MAYFIELD, Ky. — Isaiah Holt passes his days sequestered in a home that was not touched by the tornado. Still, he cannot escape the storm."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"President Biden has made “harm reduction” a central pillar of his plan to fight a record number of drug-related deaths, but a conservative backlash is threatening the effort. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to make “harm reduction” — a public health approach geared toward helping drug users stay safe rather than abstain — a central pillar of his drug policy agenda, at a time when illicit fentanyl has driven a surge in overdose deaths."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"Muscles develop a lasting molecular “memory” of past resistance exercises that helps them bounce back from long periods of inactivity. After two years of Covid-19 and its disruptions to our exercise routines, many of us may feel like we have forgotten how to be fit. But an encouraging new study suggests that our muscles remember. The study involved mice, but it builds on similar experiments with weight training and people. It found that muscles developed a pervasive and lasting molecular “memory” of past resistance exercises that helped them bounce back quickly from long layoffs."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"Starting in the 1960s, three physicians in Rochester, N.Y., began secretly using their own sperm to help women become pregnant. Like millions of Americans, David Berry was curious about his genealogy. He wanted to learn more about his paternal grandfather, whose ancestry was British. But as he explored his father’s side of the family, he discovered something wholly unexpected: The man he thought was his father was not related to him at all."

Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Around the country, a patchwork of laws was taking hold amid protest and celebration. A new and rapidly shifting reality took hold across America on Saturday as abortion, a basic legal right for nearly a half century, was outlawed in some states, and the initial bursts of elation and shock from the overturning of Roe v. Wade gave way to action."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Many of the millions of women who live in these states would be able to seek legal abortions elsewhere, but the barriers to access may be hard for some to overcome.

Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Legislators also approved a measure restricting discussion of L.G.B.T.Q. issues in public schools.

Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Doctors who provide gender-affirming care are split on how to evaluate teens.

The guidelines include a chapter on adolescents that is already generating heat from across the political spectrum."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Some women are stockpiling birth control, emergency contraception and abortion pills in case legislation prevents them from accessing it in their home state. Less than 48 hours after the Supreme Court said states could ban abortion, health care providers have noticed an increase in interest in birth control, emergency contraception and abortion pills."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"The F.D.A. criticized measures at a hydroponics greenhouse linked to an outbreak last summer, and offered guidelines that have ramifications for the popular industry. Countless salad lovers have embraced hydroponic produce, confident that baby lettuce, arugula and herbs raised indoors in greenhouses are safer than greens rooted outdoors in farm soil."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The tentative deal would close an investigation by nearly three dozen states into the company’s marketing and sales practices. Juul Labs, fighting for its survival in the United States, on Tuesday tentatively agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen states over marketing and sales practices that they contend set off the nation’s teenage vaping crisis."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"Pregnancy loss and reproductive rights are not at odds. The demise of Roe v. Wade is causing harms that extend well beyond abortion patients. In places where abortion is heavily restricted, women with ectopic pregnancies and those experiencing inevitable miscarriages have reported delays in care that have risked their health, life and future fertility. Some have struggled to get medications to treat miscarriage because those drugs are also used for abortion."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"After Kansans voted to preserve abortion access, Republicans who once said the economy reigns supreme are acknowledging the issue will be a centerpiece in the fall campaigns. Republican candidates, facing a stark reality check from Kansas voters, are softening their once-uncompromising stands against abortion as they move toward the general election, recognizing that strict bans are unpopular and that the issue may be a major driver in the fall campaigns."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"In the West, wildfires are stopping shows. Extreme heat has led to cancellations in the South. And changing weather patterns are hobbling performances in the Northeast. ASHLAND, Ore. — Smoke from a raging wildfire in California prompted the Oregon Shakespeare Festival to cancel a recent performance of “The Tempest” at its open-air theater. Record flooding in St. Louis forced the cancellation of an outdoor performance of “Legally Blonde.” And after heat and smoke at an outdoor Pearl Jam concert in France damaged the throat of its lead singer, Eddie Vedder, the band canceled several shows."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The party is turning against a political commitment to fairness. One of the recurring points I make in my column is that the Republican Party, from the most junior state lawmaker to senators in Washington, has turned against many of the hallmarks of a functional political system, including a commitment to fairness and following the process. There are almost always new examples of Republican politicians rejecting any result or rule that doesn’t favor their interests, and this week we have two."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has prompted Democratic governors to pitch their states as better alternatives for business. As a group of conservative states enacted severe abortion restrictions last year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois sent letters to a handful of corporate executives with close ties to Texas."

Arkansas,2022,Q3,"“When McKinsey Comes to Town,” by the Times reporters Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe, argues that the legendary firm has accrued an inordinate amount of influence chasing profits at the expense of moral principle. In 2002, Martin Elling, along with three colleagues at the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, published an article in the firm’s quarterly journal intended to gin up more business from the pharmaceutical industry. Elling’s article argued that drug companies were missing an opportunity by not tracking how often individual physicians were prescribing certain drugs. By aggregating such data, pharmaceutical salespeople could target their marketing pitches to the doctors most likely to become heavy prescribers, and the sales reps themselves could also be better evaluated by their companies. Soon enough, a relatively unknown drug company called Purdue Pharma came calling, retaining McKinsey in 2004 to help increase sales of its opioid pain killer OxyContin — which had already topped $1 billion annually. In the face of a worsening national opioid addiction crisis and multiple state and federal investigations, prescriptions of higher-strength OxyContin pills had begun to level off. Among other recommendations, McKinsey, led by Elling and his team, suggested “turbocharging” sales through more innovative and aggressive marketing tactics. Between 2004 and 2019, Purdue paid McKinsey $83.7 million in fees."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The continuing quest for a conservative policy reformation, and its continuing problems. The movement known as national conservatism, which just wrapped up its latest conference in Florida, is the third major attempt to solve the Republican Party’s central 21st-century policy dilemma: How does a party that historically represented the rich and big business adapt to a world where conservatism’s constituencies are not just middle class but blue-collar, downscale and disappointed with the modern American economy?"
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"He made the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees an electoral force in a time of Republican hostility to organized labor. Gerald W. McEntee, the longtime president of one of the country’s largest public employee labor unions, died on Sunday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 87."

Arkansas,2022,Q4,President Biden’s pardons for thousands of Americans convicted of possessing marijuana don’t apply to state charges or many immigrants at risk of deportation. WASHINGTON — Valerie Schultz’s conviction for possession of a small amount of marijuana in 2010 was anything but simple.
Arkansas,2022,Q4,"Workers on visas, many of them waiting years for green cards, now face having to leave the country unless they get hired within 60 days. Since Microsoft brought him to the United States 14 years ago, Abhishikt Jain has excelled professionally, raised a family and settled into a four-bedroom house with a garage “full of unnecessary stuff,” he said."
Arkansas,2022,Q4,"Prices of digital currencies have tumbled even after the exchange FTX announced a provisional lifeline by a top rival, Binance. Devastation in the crypto market continued on Wednesday, after the giant crypto exchange Binance announced a bombshell deal to buy its embattled rival, FTX. (The deal excludes FTX’s American operations.) The entire market’s capitalization now stands at $900 billion, down from $3 trillion just one year ago, while major cryptocurrencies were down by double-digit percentages. The damage is largely contained within crypto; both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed up yesterday."
Arkansas,2022,Q4,"A nonprofit on Staten Island offers a nontraditional, “ride-or-die” sphere of protection for vulnerable youth. The headquarters for the Staten Island chapter of Bikers Against Child Abuse has eight American flags, two portraits of Christopher Columbus and a stack of laminated Virgin Mary wallet inserts. Earlier this summer, a teary-eyed Billyjoe Contreras led a meeting there."
Arkansas,2023,Q1,"States can enshrine a constitutional right that the Supreme Court eliminated. The new Republican majority will soon wield power in the House of Representatives, and despite the divisions over their choice of a speaker, make no mistake: They are bent on stymieing not only President Biden’s agenda, but also efforts to protect the constitutional rights of Americans that have been whittled away by the Supreme Court and Republican-led states. Among those rights is the freedom of reproductive choice and bodily autonomy for women, which fell with the court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade last June."

Arkansas,2023,Q1,"She founded the first woman-owned lobbying firm in the country, and made her name by supporting social policy and nonprofit causes. Liz Robbins, who after opening the country’s first woman-owned lobbying firm in 1977 became one of Washington’s most successful and most beloved operators — no easy feat for someone in her profession — died on Saturday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 76."
Arkansas,2023,Q1,"One generation’s impact on the work force. The U.S. job market has staged a remarkable rebound since the start of the pandemic almost three years ago.

Arkansas,2023,Q1,"A lab leak was once dismissed by many as a conspiracy theory. But the idea is gaining traction, even as evidence builds that the virus emerged from a market. WASHINGTON — In the spring of 2021, with studies of the coronavirus pandemic’s origins going nowhere and the issue embroiled in bitter partisan politics, David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford, quietly made a request of his congresswoman."
Arkansas,2023,Q1,"Seven killed in another mass shooting in California. Seven people were shot to death yesterday afternoon in San Mateo County, Calif., the local sheriff’s office said, the second mass shooting in the state in three days. The shooting happened around 2:20 p.m. local time at two separate locations about 30 miles south of San Francisco, the authorities said. An eighth person was at a hospital with life-threatening injuries."
Arkansas,2023,Q1,President Biden was heckled during the State of the Union address when he spoke about fentanyl and when he accused Republicans of threatening Social Security and Medicare. WASHINGTON — President Biden challenged the new House Republican majority on Tuesday night to work together with him to “finish the job” of repairing America’s unsettled economy and fragile democracy even as the emboldened opposition geared up to try to force him to change course.
Arkansas,2023,Q1,"The annual anti-abortion gathering to protest Roe v. Wade is the first since the Supreme Court overturned the right to abortion. WASHINGTON — Thousands of anti-abortion activists convened on the National Mall on Friday for the March for Life, the rally held every January since 1974 to protest Roe v. Wade."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"Fixing the background check system can be done today, but it will take work. A litany of exasperating rituals flows from America’s regular mass shootings. One of the most frustrating is the hand-wringing that our politics is so polarized that there’s no way to move forward."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"After Justice Clarence Thomas cast doubt on the Supreme Court decision that established a right to contraception, reproductive rights advocates are pressing for new protections at the state level. One year after Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court should reconsider whether the Constitution affords Americans a right to birth control, Democrats and reproductive rights advocates are laying the groundwork for state-by-state battles over access to contraception — an issue they hope to turn against Republicans in 2024."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"The measure would allow parents to cancel the contracts underlying their children’s accounts on sites like TikTok, Instagram, Roblox and YouTube. Over the last year, state legislators concerned about a mental health crisis among the nation’s young people have passed a raft of children’s online safety measures. A new Utah law would require social networks to obtain a parent’s consent before giving an account to a child younger than 18 while a new California law would require many sites to turn on the highest privacy settings for minors."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"The G.O.P. has a twisted view of the safety net. Work requirements for federal assistance programs do not, well, work."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"A requirement that states keep people on Medicaid during the coronavirus pandemic has come to an end, and 15 million people could lose their coverage as a result. KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In a closet-sized windowless office, Kialah Marshall maintains an Excel spreadsheet with a prosaic title, “Medicaid Unwinding,” the source material for a mind-numbing routine."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"The rulings extend a winning streak in court for transgender-rights advocates, who are trying to block new state laws that ban gender-transition care. Federal judges in two states intervened on Wednesday to temporarily block laws that would ban gender-transition care for minors, the latest instances where legislation targeting transgender people have been halted by the judiciary."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"After the surgeon general warned that social media harms young people, young New Yorkers agreed. Some also said that the government — and their parents — should back off. In Manhattan, one high school freshman said he was trying to cut down on scrolling through TikTok, but questioned whether age restrictions on social media use could ever effectively stop tech-savvy teenagers."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"A new executive order requires every federal agency to address the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate change on minority communities. WASHINGTON — President Biden on Friday announced the creation of a White House Office of Environmental Justice, one of several actions to address the unequal burden that people of color carry from environmental hazards."

Arkansas,2023,Q3,"A Georgia judge who had temporarily blocked the ban put her ruling on hold after a federal court struck down an injunction on a similar law in Alabama. A federal judge in Georgia has allowed the state’s ban on gender transition care for minors to go back into full effect, after a federal appeals court panel allowed a similar law in Alabama to be enforced. Before the appellate ruling, the same judge, Sarah Geraghty, had granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked part of the Georgia ban."

Arkansas,2023,Q3,Cherishing family means all of your family. WASHINGTON — Even my Republican sister is not immune to Joe Biden’s gregarious Irish charm.
Arkansas,2023,Q3,"We live in two countries now: one where basic civil and human rights are recognized and another where ideological extremists can decide how everyone else lives. NASHVILLE — Two weeks ago, while the rest of America was absorbed by the hunt for a doomed submersible, people in Tennessee discovered that their attorney general was conducting a witch hunt."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"A marriage contract that makes divorce difficult is a way for some couples to protect their partnerships. However, some experts believe that this type of union has both advantages and disadvantages. Many states in America, depending on state-specific laws, allow “no-fault” divorces, in which either partner can end their marriage for any reason. But with a covenant marriage, there are stricter guidelines for ending a marriage. Revelations concerning Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, and his own covenant marriage have brought the unconventional commitment arrangement into the spotlight."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"Ohio’s governor reminds Republicans that they’re supposed to support parents’ rights, even if their children are trans. As 2023 slouches to an ignominious end, some news came Friday that gave me an unexpected jolt of hope. I have spent much of the year watching with horror and trying to document an unrelenting legal assault on queer and trans people. Around 20 states have passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans and nonbinary people, and several have barred transgender and nonbinary people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity."

Arkansas,2023,Q4,"Legislation would require parental consent for anyone under 18 to access the algorithm-based feeds on TikTok, Instagram and other platforms. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have harnessed powerful algorithms to captivate millions of users with endless streams of entertaining videos and content, transforming the way new generations scroll through their screens."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,How the G.O.P. can come up with a new approach to the politics of the issue. Electoral results since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision should tell a lot of people in the Republican Party something they absolutely do not want to hear: Even rank-and-file G.O.P. voters are not as pro-life as we might have thought when Roe v. Wade was the law of the land.
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term. The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"Children are suffering under the weight of social media. New York lawmakers believe they have a strategy to halt the damage. Over the past few years, hundreds of families and school districts around the country have sued big tech companies on the grounds that the hypnotic properties of social media popular with children have left too many of them unwell. Citing the promotion of the “corpse bride” diet, for example, and other practices around dangerous forms of weight loss, Seattle Public Schools filed a complaint in January arguing that platforms like TikTok and Snapchat have been so unsparing in their delivery of harmful material to students that the resulting anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation were interfering with the school system’s primary mission of educating children."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"Pentagon researchers say weapons like shoulder-fired rockets expose troops who fire them to blast waves far above safety limits, but they remain in wide use.

SAN FRANCISCO — With tens of thousands of people living on the streets of California, the homelessness crisis has become the state’s defining issue. For Gov.

MORAGA, Calif. — It was a high-stakes gamble: a chance to win big at the slot machines but risk getting infected with the coronavirus. Braving a cold drizzle last week, hundreds placed their bet, lining up for hours in front of the Viejas Casino and Resort, a glass-and-stone Indian casino east of San Diego that was reopening despite pleas from California’s governor, Gavin Newsom."

California,2020,Q3,"Can women be prosecuted for murder after a stillbirth? The case of Chelsea Becker in Kings County hinges on the courts’ interpretation of a small subsection in the state’s penal code. After her pregnancy ended in a stillbirth last year, a woman in California was charged with murder. Kings County prosecutors said that the fetus had died because the woman, Chelsea Becker, used methamphetamines during her pregnancy."
California,2020,Q3,"If climate change was a somewhat abstract notion a decade ago, today it is all too real for Californians fleeing wildfires and smothered in a blanket of smoke, the worst year of fires on record. SAN FRANCISCO — Multiple mega fires burning more than three million acres. Millions of residents smothered in toxic air. Rolling blackouts and triple-digit heat waves. Climate change, in the words of one scientist, is smacking California in the face."
California,2020,Q3,"Tuesday: Yes, and here’s what it would mean for the Golden State. Also: California’s coronavirus data is slightly encouraging. Good morning."

California,2020,Q4,"Friday: California currently has no travel restrictions in place. But as cases in the state reached a million, health officials are urging people to travel as little as possible. On Friday morning, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington urged their residents to avoid all nonessential interstate travel in the days ahead, joining their counterparts across the country in pleading with residents to take precautions. Read more about the announcement here. "
California,2020,Q4,"Frustrated over an order to temporarily ban outdoor dining across Los Angeles County, many elected officials have fought back — with votes to form their own health departments. LOS ANGELES — Until late last month, outdoor dining — no masks required — was the closest thing to pre-pandemic normal for the 10 million residents of Los Angeles County. But amid a record-busting surge in hospitalizations and cases of the coronavirus, the county’s health department recently said outdoor dining must come to a complete halt for the first time since May."

California,2020,Q4,"Large parks must be in the state’s “yellow” tier for economic recovery, with the virus largely contained, which could be a long wait. California health officials issued long-awaited guidance for reopening theme parks in the state on Tuesday, setting targets for when attractions like Disneyland Resort, in Anaheim, and Universal Studios Hollywood, in Los Angeles, can open their doors. For the big parks, it could be a long road: their counties must reach the least-restrictive “yellow” tier of the state’s four-tier Covid-19 economic-reopening plan."
California,2020,Q4,Monday: Who will be the first in line to receive the Covid-19 vaccines? Here’s what we know. Good morning.

California,2021,Q1,"Two studies confirm that a new coronavirus mutant in California is more contagious, although the scale of its threat is unclear. A variant first discovered in California in December is more contagious than earlier forms of the coronavirus, two new studies have shown, fueling concerns that emerging mutants like this one could hamper the sharp decline in cases over all in the state and perhaps elsewhere."
California,2021,Q1,"In the coming days, Los Angeles County will reach a level where one in 10 residents has tested positive for the coronavirus. LOS ANGELES — A sustained surge of coronavirus infections has locked Southern California in crisis, overwhelming intensive care wards, ambulance services, funeral homes and local officials."
California,2021,Q1,"Grace Community Church reversed course after Los Angeles County health officials warned that indoor conferences were prohibited and that the event could worsen the spread of the coronavirus. An evangelical megachurch, under pressure from health officials, said on Friday that it had postponed an indoor conference that was expected to draw as many as 3,000 people from across the country to Southern California."
California,2021,Q1,"For months, far-right activists have rallied against masks and lockdowns imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Now some protesters have shifted their focus to the Covid-19 vaccine. LOS ANGELES — An out-of-work stand-up comic originally from New Jersey. An actor and conservative podcast host dressed in a white lab coat. A gadfly who has run several unsuccessful campaigns for Congress in Los Angeles. And at least a few who had been in Washington the day of the Capitol riot."

California,2021,Q1,The ruling followed a similar one in a case from New York and provided more evidence of a change in the court’s direction after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

California,2021,Q1,Tuesday: The latest on the state’s efforts to vaccinate millions of people. Also: An update on the Newsom recall effort; and self-care for men. Good morning.
California,2021,Q2,"In California, both Republicans and Democrats say the threat of a recall election has shaped Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent responses to the coronavirus pandemic. SACRAMENTO — Things have been looking up in California. Vaccines will soon be available to everyone over 16. Los Angeles schools are about to bring hundreds of thousands of students back to classrooms. Disneyland, dark for a year, will throw open its gates in just a few weeks."
California,2021,Q2,"Tuesday: We explore the historical, technical, logistical and financial aspects of the attempt to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom. Good morning."

California,2021,Q2,"Officials made the move after more than 70 percent of adults in both states had received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. The governors of New York and California, the states hit earliest and hardest by the pandemic, triumphantly announced on Tuesday that they had lifted virtually all coronavirus restrictions on businesses and social gatherings as both states hit milestones in vaccinating their residents. "
California,2021,Q2,"Wednesday: In California’s rural far northern counties, furor for the recall has taken hold alongside the region’s fascination with secession. Good morning."
California,2021,Q2,"California, the nation’s most populous state, will scrap most of its complex, frequently shifting pandemic rules on Tuesday — one of the last states to do so. But that doesn’t mean the state will immediately snap back all the way to prepandemic life.

California,2021,Q2,"The air quality gets so bad from wildfires that we are left clinging to our air purifiers. SAN FRANCISCO — It’s early June, and the weeds have been brown for weeks."
California,2021,Q3,"Black women suffer from reproductive politicking more than other women.  During its coming term, the Supreme Court will review the constitutionality of a Mississippi anti-abortion law that criminalizes abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Already in Mississippi, only one abortion clinic remains to serve the entire state. This new law, one of the most restrictive anti-abortion measures yet, provides no exemptions in cases of rape or incest. Many see it as the gravest threat to Roe v. Wade ever taken up by the Supreme Court. They are not wrong."
California,2021,Q3,Monday: Reflecting on almost three years of chronicling the biggest news in the Golden State. Good morning.
California,2021,Q3,"Thursday: Los Angeles County public health officials advised wearing masks indoors, but said new restrictions were unlikely. Good morning."
California,2021,Q3,Wednesday: The demand for nonscientific water-finding services shows the desperation of farmers during a deepening drought. Good morning.
California,2021,Q3,"A crazy recall process could lead to repudiation of the state’s policy successes. If you live in California and haven’t yet voted or made plans to vote on the proposed recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom, please wake up. This is a situation in which apathy could have awesome consequences: California, which isn’t as liberal a state as you may imagine but is nonetheless considerably more liberal than the nation as a whole, may be about to absent-mindedly acquire a Trumpist governor who could never win a normal election."
California,2021,Q3,"Kevin Faulconer, a former San Diego mayor, says his collaborative approach to government will resonate with Californians weary of partisan tribalism. He was the mayor of San Diego, California’s second-largest city, for the better part of a decade until he reached his term limit last year, praised in some quarters for being an increasingly rare moderate Republican in a state where the G.O.P. has struggled."
California,2021,Q3,"The bill would rein in production quotas at warehouses that critics say are excessive and force workers to forgo bathroom breaks. Among the pandemic’s biggest economic winners is Amazon, which nearly doubled its annual profit last year to $21 billion and is on pace to far exceed that total this year."
California,2021,Q3,"Californians will soon vote on whether to recall their Democratic governor. Could he lose? California Republicans began the effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom before the pandemic upended everything. But without a doubt, the pandemic enabled the recall: The courts gave organizers more time to collect the necessary signatures, and Newsom’s handling of the pandemic, including his visit to a swanky restaurant in wine country amid his own lockdown orders, eroded his support."
California,2021,Q3,Similar mandates have gained momentum among both public and private employers as cases have jumped across the country with the spread of the Delta variant. California became the first state to issue a vaccine mandate for all educators in public and private schools on Wednesday when Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered teachers and school staff members to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or face weekly testing.
California,2021,Q3,"Counties with above-average levels of vaccination have some of the lowest Covid-19 hospitalization rates.

California,2021,Q4,"Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for a 15 percent reduction in water usage, but we’re far from that target. The results are in: Californians aren’t saving enough water."
California,2021,Q4,"The discovery in San Francisco County prompted the Biden administration to renew calls for everyone to get fully vaccinated and receive a booster, if eligible. WASHINGTON — The Omicron coronavirus variant was reported in the United States for the first time on Wednesday in a traveler who had been in South Africa, as scientists around the world study whether the variant is more transmissible or virulent than its predecessors."
California,2021,Q4,"About one in five support Roe v. Wade being overturned, a number that has remained largely unchanged for more than a decade. The hundreds of women’s marches staged across the country over the weekend had a clear rallying cry: Don’t let America go the way of Texas."
California,2021,Q4,"The most populous state is considering big changes to math instruction. Today, we’re looking at California’s proposal to change math instruction, and a plan for a new university championed by conservative thinkers."
California,2021,Q4,"Once an anti-vaccine stronghold, Marin County has become an unlikely champion of Covid-19 shots. But will it last? The pocket of California that has emerged as a leader in Covid-19 vaccinations may come as a surprise."
California,2021,Q4,"The state has become the first to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for schoolchildren. In some ways, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent decision to require Covid-19 vaccinations for all schoolchildren as early as next year is straight out of the California pandemic playbook."
California,2021,Q4,"After breaking a record earlier this month, fuel prices have kept climbing. For so many of us, the upcoming holiday season offers a moment of normalcy in what has been a long and lonely pandemic."
California,2021,Q4,"During Día de Muertos, or Day of the Dead, we remember those who have been lost. ENCINITAS, Calif. — The celebratory chords of a mariachi band filled the community center. On seemingly every surface fresh marigold blossoms glowed a bright orange."
California,2021,Q4,"The climate pattern could bring very different fortunes for northern and southern parts of the state. For California, the arrival of winter means the beginning of our rainy season, at least relatively speaking."
California,2021,Q4,"Children from kindergarten to 12th grade in both public and private schools will be required to be inoculated against the coronavirus once the F.D.A. gives full approval.

California,2022,Q1,"It’s more than just the absence of months of snow and subzero temperatures. A reader who moved from New York to the Bay Area emailed me recently, “The best part of winter in California is that there is no winter.”"
California,2022,Q1,"The state might be drought-stricken, fire-ridden and wildly expensive, but our readers love it all the same. It’s been a long week, so this morning I’m offering a little serotonin boost to carry us into the weekend."
California,2022,Q1,"Officials are expected to announce a plan on Monday for relaxing the state’s classroom mask mandate. With the Omicron variant in retreat across much of the country, federal officials on Friday inched toward a new pandemic normal by easing their guidelines for staying safe from the coronavirus."
California,2022,Q1,"The move does not change the requirement for masks in classrooms. California is set to end a universal indoor mask mandate next week and roll back other restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus, officials announced on Monday."
California,2022,Q1,"More than 20 percent of coronavirus tests have come back positive over the past week, according to the statewide average. How fast is the coronavirus spreading in California?"
California,2022,Q1,"A task force in charge of the state’s reparations effort, the first in the nation, is struggling to decide which Black Californians should receive payments. If California were to provide reparations for Black residents, who exactly should qualify for the payments?"
California,2022,Q1,"In 2022, the state is offering more film tax credits than ever before. “Veep.” “You.” “Miracle Workers.” “American Horror Story.” “Lucifer.” “Good Girls.”"
California,2022,Q1,"In Los Angeles Unified, which will reopen next week, testing had been optional for vaccinated and asymptomatic students and employees. That changed on Monday. SACRAMENTO — With the Omicron variant raging across California, millions of schoolchildren returned to classrooms on Monday, ending the holiday break as many had spent it — masked, distanced, apprehensive and in long lines with their parents, scrambling for coronavirus tests."
California,2022,Q1,"For the past 10 years, wolves have been steadily returning to the state after being wiped out a century ago. But not everyone is rolling out the welcome mat. Kent Laudon, a wolf biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, woke up one morning last year to a flurry of text messages from a rancher in the state’s northernmost county. He was asking about a post with wildly specific details spreading across Facebook that urged people to find a red truck that was transporting breeding wolves along Route 97 into Siskiyou County, Calif. Mr. Laudon was not surprised. This wasn’t the first post of its kind, and it wouldn’t be the last."
California,2022,Q1,"Blame Silicon Valley. Of the 100 wealthiest people in America, 26 live in California."
California,2022,Q2,Coronavirus cases in the Golden State have increased by 18 percent over the past two weeks. Rising coronavirus cases in the Northeast and the proliferation of the highly transmissible BA.2 subvariant raise the inevitable question: Is another Covid surge coming to California?
California,2022,Q2,"Though fires increasingly erupt year-round in the Golden State, those in the summer and fall tend to be far more destructive. It’s almost July, which is typically the beginning of California’s fire season."
California,2022,Q2,"Have you noticed a rise in anxiety, depression and other serious mental health disorders among your generation? What can be done to help? Note to Teachers: This writing prompt is part of a larger unit on mental health, which also includes a lesson plan, a film and a graph discussion. Please preview these resources to make sure they are appropriate for your students. "
California,2022,Q2,"There are thousands of apps that claim to promote mental well-being, but not all of them are safe or effective. With therapists in high demand and long waiting lists that make it challenging to find a provider, using a mental health app might seem like a tempting and relatively inexpensive way to get help."
California,2022,Q2,"Rules announced around the state are considered merely an incremental solution to a far-reaching, permanent problem. For 15 years, Jeffrey Kightlinger was the general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to about 19 million people — nearly half of all Californians — across six counties, including Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego."
California,2022,Q2,"State officials have lifted mask mandates for most places, but not everywhere. To mask or not to mask? That is the question."
California,2022,Q2,"Lounges where customers consume cannabis on site are the next frontier of the state’s recreational marijuana industry. OJAI, Calif. — Imagine a restaurant where you can order dark chocolate infused with cannabis, or where you can pick a pre-rolled joint from a menu and light up at your table. Think of your neighborhood Starbucks or local dive bar, but with marijuana on tap."
California,2022,Q2,"Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Alameda Counties have the highest Covid case rates in the state. Since the early days of the pandemic, the Bay Area has been seen as a model for how to minimize the spread of the coronavirus."
California,2022,Q2,"As conservative states move to enact far-right legislative agendas, California leaders say they’re spearheading the resistance. If there’s one thing we know about California’s officials, it’s that they love to declare that California is a leader in everything — whether it’s tackling climate change or transforming the world through technology."
California,2022,Q2,"About 10,600 more people are expected to come to California for abortion care each year, according to a U.C.L.A. report.

Wade, Gloria Allred told the crowd about an illegal abortion that almost killed her."
California,2022,Q3,The measure will create a state council to establish minimum pay and regulate safety conditions on an industrywide basis. California will enact a sweeping new approach to regulating fast-food restaurants after Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that he had signed a bill to effectively set a minimum wage in the industry and to create new safety and anti-discrimination rules.
California,2022,Q3,"Los Angeles County, San Francisco and the state as a whole have issued emergency declarations because of the growing outbreak. California this week became the latest state to step up its response to monkeypox, with Gov. Gavin Newsom declaring a state of emergency on Monday because of the growing outbreak."
California,2022,Q3,"As several cities in Northern California set records, some experts are trying to draw more attention to the effects of hot weather. On Tuesday, the heat dome punishing the West continued its suffocating stay over California, sending temperatures to all-time highs, making it harder to fight the wildfires now burning in various parts of the state and contributing to any post-holiday malaise residents may have been experiencing."
California,2022,Q3,"The closing of a meatpacking plant near downtown Los Angeles has left its workers reeling and amplified questions about doing business in the state. VERNON, Calif. — Teresa Robles begins her shift around dawn most days at a pork processing plant in an industrial corridor four miles south of downtown Los Angeles. She spends eight hours on her feet cutting tripe, a repetitive motion that has given her constant joint pain, but also a $17.85-an-hour income that supports her family."
California,2022,Q3,"Dr. Courtney Pedersen and Eddie Bearnot, who both work to promote health in others, overcame a medical crisis of their own. Dr. Courtney Jo Pedersen saw Edward Collin Bearnot as more of an obstacle than a potential suitor when he offered to buy her a drink during a meet-up of Yale’s graduate men’s and women’s rugby teams in September 2015."
California,2022,Q3,"Our reader-built playlist continues to grow. Imagine you’re planning a road trip along the length of the California coast, from Imperial Beach to Crescent City."
California,2022,Q3,"Should we turn strip malls and office parks into homes, even if it means hiring nonunion workers? One cause of California’s severe shortage of housing is well known: The state is plagued by byzantine zoning rules and other local restrictions on development that make it extraordinarily difficult to build new places to live. In other words, NIMBYism."
California,2022,Q3,The state is shoring up resources to be the nation’s abortion refuge. .
California,2022,Q3,"Blistering temperatures shattered records over Labor Day weekend. Meteorologists say they’ll linger for the rest of the week.

In Death Valley, it was a blinding 121 degrees."
California,2022,Q3,"After lobbying by the governor, lawmakers adopted $54 billion in climate spending and voted to keep open the state’s last nuclear plant. California, with an economy that ranks as the world’s fifth-largest, embarked this week on its most aggressive effort yet to confront climate change, after lawmakers passed a flurry of bills designed to cut emissions and speed away from fossil fuels."
California,2022,Q4,"Supporters of decriminalization, which takes effect Jan. 1, say the laws have disproportionately targeted people based on race and economic status. Jason Sarris was rebuilding his life. He was going to become sober, renew his driver’s license and find stable housing after being homeless for 12 years. But there was one extra thing holding him back: Nearly $5,000 in fines for jaywalking and similar offenses."
California,2022,Q4,A disease doesn’t respect borders. Global health leaders must fight tomorrow’s pandemic today by ensuring health equity across the globe. 
California,2022,Q4,"The state is undertaking the nation’s most ambitious effort so far to compensate for the economic legacy of slavery and racism. In the two years since nationwide social justice protests followed the murder of George Floyd, California has undertaken the nation’s most sweeping effort yet to explore some concrete restitution to Black citizens to address the enduring economic effects of slavery and racism."
California,2022,Q4,"The nearly six-week walkout had disrupted research and classes across the renowned public system as employees sought higher pay and benefits.

California,2022,Q4,"The state’s voters had overwhelmingly supported letting a two-year-old law take effect, and lower courts had refused to put it on hold. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to block a California law banning flavored tobacco, clearing the way for the ban to take effect next week."
California,2022,Q4,"The state’s efforts to increase voter turnout also mean delays in vote tallying. The election was over a week ago, but we’re still anxiously awaiting the results of several key races."
California,2022,Q4,"Students receive $10,000 from the state to pay tuition and living expenses in exchange for 450 hours of community service work. Of the hundreds of laws signed and initiatives overseen by Gov. Gavin Newsom while in office, a new state program is the one that he’s “probably more proud” of than anything else."
California,2022,Q4,"The Regents chose not to block U.C.L.A. from leaving the Pac-12. But it attached conditions that could cost the school more than $20 million annually, including some money that would be diverted to U.C. Berkeley. LOS ANGELES — The University of California Board of Regents voted on Wednesday to approve U.C.L.A.’s move to the Big Ten Conference, but attached conditions meant to ensure that money the school reaps from its new league’s lucrative television contract would offset the byproducts of athletes making repeated trips across the country for sporting events."
California,2022,Q4,"U.C. administrators and a majority of union leaders have a deal to end the walkout, but there’s a movement afoot to convince the rank and file to reject the agreement. Last week, when the University of California and negotiators for striking academic workers announced a tentative agreement to end the work stoppage that began on Nov. 14, union representatives praised the proposed contract."
California,2023,Q1,"The nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order was announced on March 19, 2020. It’s been a long three years."
California,2023,Q1,"Berkeley was the first city in the nation to ban gas hookups in most new homes and buildings, a policy adopted in 2019. You may have heard chatter recently about gas stoves: whether they’re bad for your health, or the planet’s, and whether they’re soon going to be banned in your city or state."
California,2023,Q1,"Seeking to shut down the nation’s largest death row, the governor is proceeding with a mix of conviction and caution. In 2022, a remarkable thing happened: In the heat of an election in which Republicans seized on the public’s fears of crime, support for capital punishment barely moved, if at all."
California,2023,Q1,"We look at five important changes that took effect on Jan. 1. A new year doesn’t always usher in sweeping change, but in California, at least, it usually means a slate of new laws going into effect."
California,2023,Q1,"The popular drug discount app deceptively shared details on users’ illnesses and medicines with ad firms, regulators said in a legal complaint. Millions of Americans have used GoodRx, a drug discount app, to search for lower prices on prescriptions like antidepressants, H.I.V. medications and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases at their local drugstores. But U.S. regulators say the app’s coupons and convenience came at a high cost for users: wrongful disclosure of their intimate health information."
California,2023,Q1,"The state is still reeling from back-to-back attacks that left at least 19 people dead. The killings have spurred lawmakers to call for more regulations. SACRAMENTO — California bans guns for domestic violence offenders. It bans them for people deemed a danger to others or themselves. There is a ban on large-capacity magazines, and a ban on noise-muffling silencers. Semiautomatic guns of the sort colloquially known as “assault weapons” are, famously, banned."
California,2023,Q1,"“One in every nine tanks of gas, diesel or jet fuel pumped in California comes from the Amazon,” one researcher said. If you live in California, you may have a closer connection to oil drilling in the Amazon rainforest than you think."
California,2023,Q1,"The decision lessens the chances that gig drivers will be considered employees in the state, but it is expected to be appealed to the state Supreme Court. A California appeals court said on Monday that Proposition 22, the ballot measure passed by state voters in 2020 that classified Uber and Lyft drivers as independent contractors rather than as employees, should remain state law."
California,2023,Q1,"The emergency expired May 11, complicating access to tests and treatment in the U.S. The Biden administration ended the pandemic’s classification as a public health emergency on May 11, a move that ushers in an elaborate wave of policy changes that may complicate Americans’ testing and treatment options for the disease."
California,2023,Q1,"Unlike in colder-weather states, most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They are experiencing a long stretch of fierce storms in a way few others are. SACRAMENTO — The wind on the American River was blowing the rain nearly sideways. Just two nights before, a nearby tree toppled onto a woman, killing her as she slept. Through the flap of a makeshift tent, Jose Reyes, 50, peered into the whipping downpour as cold water pelted his leaky tarp and sluiced down the rusty bed frame he was using as ballast. His sleeping bag was soaked. So were his socks and pant legs."

Several more cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were reported in the United States on Thursday, including five people in New York City and on Long Island, officials said. Other cases were reported in Minnesota, Hawaii, California and Colorado."
Colorado,2021,Q4,"The main reason for the discrepancies is that state and county data does not always properly link the record of people’s booster shots to their initial vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which millions of Americans rely on for up-to-date information on vaccination rates in their communities, recently acknowledged that its data might overestimate the number of people who have received first doses while underestimating the number who have received booster shots."
Colorado,2021,Q4,"The injured, all students at Aurora Central High School in Colorado, were shot at nearby Nome Park. They range in age from 14 to 18.

Colorado,2021,Q4,"Officials are seeking to avert a winter surge; last year, so many Covid patients died that officials were forced to deploy mobile morgues. California is opening up eligibility for booster coronavirus vaccine shots to include anyone 18 or over, making it at least the second state to expand official eligibility beyond older adults and people in high-risk circumstances. Colorado took a similar step this week. "

Colorado,2021,Q4,"He showed that while a healthy lifestyle won’t help us live much longer, it can stave off chronic disease and disability until our final years. James F. Fries majored in philosophy as an undergraduate, so it’s no surprise that as a medical researcher he was obsessed with how to lead a good life, even though his interest was more about physical than moral well-being."
Colorado,2021,Q4,"The adult hyenas, who tested positive for the coronavirus, have so far exhibited mild symptoms of Covid, but they are believed to be “in good shape and improving,” a zoo spokesman said.

Colorado,2022,Q1,"Dogs and cats have surprised their owners by gaining weight during the coronavirus pandemic. Veterinarians blame the extra treats and table scraps.

His cute, shaggy look not only obscured his weight, it also made it harder for the Holbrooks to resist his begging."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"The plan aims to inoculate Democrats in conservative-leaning states from Republican attacks on cultural issues, underscoring how successful the G.O.P. has been at weaponizing them. WASHINGTON — A cluster of House Democrats from conservative-leaning districts is circulating a reworked legislative agenda for the coming election season that would embrace some of President Biden’s most popular initiatives and tackle rising prices while distancing lawmakers from the left’s most divisive ideas."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"Democrats were cheered for strict lockdowns and pandemic precautions. Now many weary voters want to hear the party’s plan for living with the coronavirus. When the coronavirus pandemic first swept Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf closed stores and schools and ordered millions of citizens to stay home. Even four months into the crisis in 2020, all but “life-sustaining” businesses in much of the state were locked down."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"After a scare in November, New Jersey’s governor and other Democratic leaders held back-channel talks over lifting mandates and helping voters impatient with restrictions reclaim a sense of normalcy. Gov. Kathy Hochul will drop New York’s stringent indoor mask mandate on Wednesday, ending a requirement that businesses ask customers for proof of full vaccination or require mask wearing at all times, and marking a turning point in the state’s coronavirus response, according to three people briefed on her decision."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"And if so, how can I tell if I’m overdoing it? Q: I hike seven miles per day, spend five to six hours per week in vigorous fitness exercise, and about four hours per week performing heavy resistance training. Is it possible to exercise too much? And how much is too much?"

She was 81."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"Hold off before freaking out about that new C.D.C. diabetes study. I got a lot of feedback on my last newsletter, about how parents of children under 5 are struggling in a variety of ways with the pandemic’s current Omicron wave. Some readers felt I didn’t adequately underscore the point that statistically speaking, the risk of serious illness and death for children with Covid is very slim."
Colorado,2022,Q2,"Demand for medication abortion is surging, setting the stage for new legal battles.

Colorado,2022,Q2,"Several states have already taken steps to protect abortion rights, and many are taking additional measures in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling. Out of 50 states, there are 13 that have passed so-called trigger laws that would outlaw abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. But what’s happening in states that do not have a trigger law?"

She was 81."
Colorado,2022,Q2,"In many places, there is no system for sharing home test results with health officials, but the information may still be beneficial for public health.

Colorado,2022,Q2,"In “Under the Skin,” Linda Villarosa disproves once and for all the theory that people of color are responsible for their own failed health care. In 1973, two Black girls, 14-year-old Minnie Lee Relf and her 12-year-old sister, Mary Alice, were forcibly taken from their home in Montgomery, Ala., and sterilized at a clinic funded by the federal government. Their parents — who had been displaced from rural Alabama into a cardboard shanty in the city and could not read or write — were tricked into agreeing to the procedure. Two years earlier, doctors had already begun to inject their oldest daughter, 15-year-old Katie, with the Depo-Provera contraceptive, then unapproved even for adult women, never mind teenagers."
Colorado,2022,Q2,"The lawsuit argues that the state’s ban violates several provisions in the State Constitution, including the right to determine family composition and the right to equality between the sexes.

Colorado,2022,Q3,"A meditation on skulls, in which the skulls themselves get to have an opinion. This poem is part of a sonnet sequence that meditates on Andrea Modica’s photographs of skulls unearthed from the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo. In this sonnet (there’s a dropped line in the poem, making it technically 15 lines — one more than a traditional sonnet), the speaker compares two kinds of skulls: anonymous skulls at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh and the tagged and mounted skulls in Colorado. Paisley Rekdal’s poems are often struck with intellect, and this one is no different — in the second part of the poem during the volta, or the turn in a sonnet, the skulls are animated with their own opinions. The syntax mirrors a thinking mind. Note all the interruptions, from the em-dash after “rain,” to the commas, to the colon after “witnesses,” to the line breaks, as if to say that the only way to make sense of horror is to populate it with the turning language of logic."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"Getting a mental health diagnosis can be a huge relief. But can the label become a problem? Five years ago, seemingly out of nowhere, my brain fell into an abyss of unrelenting intrusive thoughts — What if I harm myself? What if I harm others? What if I’m crazy? — each of which was accompanied by electric shocks of anxiety and full-on sensations of dread. It was, by far, the most terrifying, vexing and isolating period of my life. My first moment of relief came four weeks later, when I finally got in to see a psychiatrist."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"As states report less frequently, changes in the trajectory of the virus are slower to reveal themselves. At a glance, the pandemic picture in the United States may seem remarkably stable.

Colorado,2022,Q3,"While some mass shootings are committed by people with diagnosed mental illnesses, a life crisis is a better predictor of violence, researchers say. The freshman who walked into the high school cafeteria in Marysville, Wash., in 2014 with his father’s .40-caliber Beretta did not fit anyone’s profile of a mass murderer. He was a crack athlete. He embraced his Native American traditions, wearing a headdress at tribal events and offering freshly killed deer to his grandmother. He was popular, so much so that he had just been elected homecoming prince."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"Even in some states where abortion remains legal, wait times for appointments are long because of increased demand. The reversal of Roe v. Wade did not affect the legal status of abortion in New Mexico, where seven clinics are still operating. But that does not mean an abortion is easy to obtain there."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"The state that spurred the overturning of abortion rights is among 17 that have not adopted a new option to extend new mothers’ Medicaid coverage for a year. JACKSON, Miss. — Like low-income pregnant women around the country, nearly every patient at the Sisters in Birth clinic here is covered by Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor.

Colorado,2022,Q3,"In the West, wildfires are stopping shows. Extreme heat has led to cancellations in the South. And changing weather patterns are hobbling performances in the Northeast. ASHLAND, Ore. — Smoke from a raging wildfire in California prompted the Oregon Shakespeare Festival to cancel a recent performance of “The Tempest” at its open-air theater. Record flooding in St. Louis forced the cancellation of an outdoor performance of “Legally Blonde.” And after heat and smoke at an outdoor Pearl Jam concert in France damaged the throat of its lead singer, Eddie Vedder, the band canceled several shows."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"Everyone and their mother seems to be playing. What’s the draw — and is it really a workout? Now that their son is grown and their water-loving Labrador retriever has passed away, Kristen Miller and her husband, Scott Miller, have decided to fill in their San Diego swimming pool. “No one uses it, there’s a drought and we’re in our 60s,” she said. “We decided YOLO, like the kids say. We’re gonna put in a frickin’ pickleball court.”"
Colorado,2022,Q3,"It is the only one of the company’s more than 500 stores with a formal union, but similar moves are afoot elsewhere.

Hours before it was hit by a deadly mass shooting Saturday night, Club Q in Colorado Springs posted on Facebook about a planned “all ages drag brunch” on Sunday morning. The event was described by the club as a celebration of the Transgender Day of Remembrance, which honors the memory of transgender people who lost their lives to anti-transgender violence."
Colorado,2022,Q4,"Policies in some states are also hurting efforts to keep children safe. Twenty-three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States.

Colorado,2022,Q4,"With Republicans taking control of the House in January, the chances that Congress will consider any added restrictions in next two years are also exceedingly slim.

Colorado,2022,Q4,"Mental health experts say that many American men are in crisis. One solution is to convince them that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. Mental health experts have long known that while women have nearly twice the rate of depression diagnoses, men are much more likely to die by suicide, drug overdose and alcohol related deaths — sometimes referred to as deaths of despair. Nearly 80 percent of suicides are among men, with males over age 75 and those who work in traditionally blue collar jobs, such as mining, construction and agriculture, having the highest rates."

Both had jobs at a local medical clinic: Mr. Ferguson was interning in the dental department. Ms. Prendergast was filing papers and filling out immunization cards alongside her best friend, Tara Jo Ferguson (no relation to Mr. Ferguson).

Connecticut,2021,Q4,"Contraception would reduce abortions. Why doesn’t the anti-abortion movement promote it? Often an abortion happens because a woman is pregnant when she didn’t intend to be.

Instead, they’re largely standing in the way."

Even when she was on the phone, she often muted herself so friends and family wouldn’t worry. "

Connecticut,2023,Q3,"Modern medicine is constantly showing us our guts and bones. Why doesn’t it feel more profound? It wasn’t that I thought medical imaging was simple, precisely.

Delaware,2023,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage.

But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."

To combat this crisis in New York City and save lives, Mayor Bill de Blasio decided to support an initiative rife with controversy: In November 2021, his government allowed OnPoint, a nonprofit, to open two overdose prevention centers, where people with addictions can inject or smoke drugs like opioids and stimulants under medical supervision to reduce the risk of overdose death. Upon taking office, Mayor Eric Adams, Mr. de Blasio’s successor, has continued to support the sites’ work."

District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"Medicaid expansion is just the latest example of how liberal policies make for good politics. When left-wing Democrats push for universal benefits and expansive new policies, they do so with a theory of politics in mind. It goes like this: The reason to fight for debt-free college or Medicare for all isn’t just to improve life for Americans, but to build new ground for progressive political activity. New programs create new constituencies, and new programs with broad benefits can give more Americans a stake in the expansion and preservation of the welfare state. Conservatives know this. That’s why they’ve fought so hard to block or undermine even modest new programs."

District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"You won’t be buying a rapid spit test anytime soon. But nose-swab versions might be on the way. For months, public health experts have been eagerly watching the companies developing spit tests for the coronavirus that could be used at home, producing results in a matter of minutes."
District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"Some pharmaceutical companies are scaling back their participation in a federally mandated drug discount program. State attorneys general are demanding that the administration take action. WASHINGTON — Some of the nation’s top pharmaceutical companies have stopped giving federally mandated drug discounts to hospitals and clinics that care for the poorest Americans, a move that is prompting bipartisan calls for the health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, to demand reinstatement of the price breaks or punish the firms."
District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"Technology to alert people exposed to the virus could slow transmission, pilot studies show, but only if people and states sign up. So far, most haven’t. Last spring, Apple and Google launched an ambitious effort to harness technology in the fight against Covid-19, building a powerful smartphone tool that would alert people of possible exposure to the coronavirus."

District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"Read more about the plans by top officials to move toward something resembling normalcy. The coronavirus pandemic has crippled economies, shut down travel and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, transforming the world in ways that would have been unthinkable a year ago. The Biden administration’s first days were inevitably dominated by discussion of how his team would tackle the crisis, as the U.S. death toll continued its inexorable climb to a staggering milestone: 500,000 deaths."
District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"Although low-income communities of color have been affected disproportionately by the coronavirus, health officials in many cities say that people from wealthier, largely white neighborhoods have been flooding vaccination appointment systems and taking an outsize share of the limited supply.

District of Columbia,2021,Q1,Large swaths of the United States still refuse to follow simple advice from experts. The next phase of the pandemic in the United States will most likely be determined by two factors: the new virus variants and the vaccine rollout.
District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"The OxyContin maker filed its long-awaited restructuring plan in bankruptcy court. Revenue from the new company would go exclusively to abating the opioid crisis. In a filing that signifies the beginning of the end of the country’s most notorious manufacturer of prescription opioids, Purdue Pharma submitted its bankruptcy restructuring plan just before midnight on Monday. The blueprint requires members of the billionaire Sackler family to relinquish control of the company and transforms it into a new corporation with revenue directed exclusively toward abating the addiction epidemic that its signature painkiller, OxyContin, helped create."

District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"Mask mandates are often the last pandemic public health order to be lifted, as stay-at-home orders and forced business closures become a thing of the past. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered on Tuesday new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors, people across the United States are living under an often confusing patchwork of limits, one that could continue for some time."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"The C.D.C. had imposed an eviction moratorium, saying it was needed to address the coronavirus pandemic. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to lift a moratorium on evictions that had been imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in response to the coronavirus pandemic."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,Scores of appointments were canceled after the U.S. called for a halt on the use of the Johnson & Johnson shot. Here’s the story behind that decision. Federal health agencies have called for a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus shot while they examine a rare blood-clotting disorder that emerged in six women who received the vaccine.
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,The moves come as President Biden pushed up the deadline to make all adults eligible for a vaccine and as the pace of inoculations is accelerating in the country. New Hampshire and Oklahoma announced plans this week to open up vaccine eligibility to outside residents as supply grows and more states expand eligibility.

District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"Only two in five federal inmates have gotten at least one shot so far, compared with three-fifths of adults nationwide. Despite the elevated risk behind bars, mistrust and refusal rates run high. Vaccinations in many American prisons, jails and detention centers are lagging far behind the United States as a whole, prompting public health officials to worry that these settings will remain fertile ground for frequent, fast-spreading coronavirus outbreaks for a long time to come."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"OSHA has saved many lives in its 50 years. But it can do more. Fifty years ago today, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration opened its doors, American workplaces were full of dangers. In 1970, an average of 38 workers were killed on the job every day, and many thousands more were injured or sickened by exposures to toxic chemicals. The law that created OSHA was revolutionary: It established, for the first time, the right to a safe workplace, free of serious hazards. Businesses had to comply with federal regulations and permit inspectors to examine their facilities."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"Philadelphia is demonstrating how cities can help tenants and landlords. Halting most evictions during the coronavirus pandemic was a necessary act of emergency medicine. Federal, state and local moratoriums allowed millions of Americans to stay in their homes when they couldn’t afford to pay rent. But that success is now at risk of unraveling."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"There is an effective approach to breaking the preschool-to-prison pipeline. The boy I’ll call Jackson is the kind of youngster who drives a preschool teacher around the bend. The 4-year-old bites and hits other children, and curses out his teacher, Mariana Lopez. During circle time, when the class is supposed to cluster around and listen to one another, he is a hellion, and nap time turns into a pitched battle. Preschool teachers rely on parents to relate what’s happening on the home front, but Jackson’s mom refused to meet with Ms. Lopez because she felt her son was being persecuted."
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"Mask mandates protect children only when masking is universal. This is not a hard concept to understand.

Many state and local lobbying campaigns have been shut down.
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"In California and New York, where mandates for health care workers have gone into effect, many are complying. SACRAMENTO — As California’s requirement that all health care workers be vaccinated against the coronavirus took effect on Thursday, major health systems reported that the mandate had helped boost their vaccination rates to 90 percent or higher. In New York, another mandate that began this week compelled thousands of hospital and nursing home workers to get shots. And at several major corporations, executives reported surges in vaccination rates after adding their own requirements."
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"Some parents feel awkward and reluctant to discuss bodies, consent and sexuality; their kids pay the price. When a friend of mine took her kids to the pediatrician’s office a few weeks ago, her 7-year-old daughter noticed a birth-control poster and asked her about it. Soon after, her 4-year-old son began peppering her with sex questions too: “But Mom, why would a penis ever go into a vagina? Did Dad put his penis into your vagina?”"

District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"The agreement would allow funds to begin flowing from the companies to states and communities to pay for addiction and prevention services. After nearly two years of wrangling, the country’s three major drug distributors and a pharmaceutical giant have reached a $26 billion deal with states that would release some of the biggest companies in the industry from all civil liability in the opioid epidemic, a decades-long public health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans."
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"The military and the Department of Veterans Affairs report higher inoculation rates, as do some companies and states, but they have a long way to go.

District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"The looming wave is shaking the rickety infrastructure that has kept schools running.

District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"Average blood pressure readings increased as the coronavirus spread, new research suggests. The finding portends medical repercussions far beyond Covid-19.

District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"A district in London has developed an innovative way to divert subway heat for buildings to lower carbon emissions. Other cities are getting creative, as well. The London Underground is the oldest subway system in the world, so it might seem an unlikely source of innovation for one of the thorniest problems facing humanity in the 21st century: climate change."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"The states were examining whether the actions of Facebook, now called Meta, violated state consumer protection laws and put the public at risk. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, for promoting its social media app Instagram while knowing of mental and emotional harms caused by the service."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"The U.S. is one of six countries with no national paid leave. The Democrats have cut their plan to four weeks, which would still make it an outlier. Congress is now considering four weeks of paid family and medical leave, down from the 12 weeks that were initially proposed in the Democrats’ spending plan. If the plan becomes law, the United States will no longer be one of six countries in the world — and the only rich country — without any form of national paid leave."

District of Columbia,2022,Q1,"The former president falsely claimed that white Americans were being denied the Covid-19 vaccine, among other inaccuracies.

District of Columbia,2022,Q1,"The elaborate scheme, which took place from 2017 to 2020 in Washington State, cost insurers $1 million, the authorities said. The collisions often took place at night on desolate roads, investigators said: that way there would be no witnesses."

District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"The virus “is not known to linger in the air,” agency officials said. But the research is far from definitive.

District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"But prior infection does not guarantee protection from the virus, officials said, and Americans should still get vaccinated and boosted. Sixty percent of Americans, including 75 percent of children, had been infected with the coronavirus by February, federal health officials reported on Tuesday — another remarkable milestone in a pandemic that continues to confound expectations."
District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"Even as cases rise, genetic analysis suggests that the virus has been silently circulating in people since 2018.

VANCOUVER, Wash. — In March, five months before he became the Republican nominee in a Washington State congressional race, Joe Kent appeared on a webcast hosted by a Gen-Z white nationalist group called the American Populist Union. Kent, who would soon be endorsed by Donald Trump, was there to explain his disavowal of Nick Fuentes, a smirking 24-year-old far-right influencer whom The New York Times has described as “a prominent white supremacist.”"

What makes a family dynasty? It starts with multigenerational success, of course, but it usually takes something more — a sense of common mission. The Kennedys and Bushes haven’t just reached great heights; they’ve stood for something, or at least they’ve created the expectation that they do. In “Morgenthau,” Andrew Meier makes a 1,046-page case for a different kind of dynasty, one where the protagonists have little in common except their inherited privilege."

District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"Mold in homes is a costly crisis that often accompanies hurricanes and flooding, and climate change is amplifying the rain that feeds outbreaks. On Tuesday morning, six days after Hurricane Ian tore through southwestern Florida, Alvaro “Moe” Zuluaga and his team of mold remediators walked through a house in Naples.

District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"“Granny flats” are popping up in backyards across the country, affording Americans a new housing option. Some communities are not happy about it. Forty-five years ago, Betty Szudy and her wife, Maggie Roth, both 70, bought a Craftsman bungalow in Oakland, Calif. In 2017, at the same time their son and his wife were fruitlessly searching for an affordable apartment in the neighborhood, California was liberalizing its housing laws to encourage so-called accessory dwelling units, or A.D.U.s."

District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"A 2011 mass shooting left Gabrielle Giffords, then a Democratic congresswoman, partly paralyzed and unable to speak fluently. She has since built a powerful advocacy group. WASHINGTON — Twelve years after a bullet ripped through the left side of her brain, Gabrielle Giffords speaks mainly in stock phrases and short bursts, conveying meaning with her eyes or a boxer’s swing of her left arm, the one that is still fully mobile. “Enough is enough!” she might say. Or: “Be passionate! Be courageous!”"

District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"Fixing the background check system can be done today, but it will take work. A litany of exasperating rituals flows from America’s regular mass shootings.

District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"The opinion from a federal judge in Texas is a legal travesty. The Friday-night ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk purporting to stay the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone for use in early abortions is a travesty — for women’s health care, principles of democracy, notions of judicial impartiality and the rule of law."
District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"Experts call it a consequential change in the care of some older people and others with limits on their mental functioning. Conservative Texans and liberal Californians disagree on much in politics. But legislators in both states agree on a new approach to giving people with cognitive impairments a greater chance for self-determination. It’s called supported decision-making, and it is shaping up to be the most consequential change in the care of older people and others with limitations in mental functioning since the rise of advance care directives in the 1990s."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"The help that caregivers need goes far beyond the nuts and bolts of caregiving and its financial costs. Most people don’t like to think about growing old. But when asked, most Americans 55 or older say they want to do so at home. The appeal is understandable. Aging in place, surrounded by familiar places, faces and memories, can provide a sense of comfort and independence. It may seem a modest ambition, but the logistical and economic realities are daunting. Even healthy older people may struggle with basic tasks of daily life, so most of them will, at some point, require help from a caregiver, paid or unpaid, to remain at home."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"The Army colonel overseeing the court-martial trial had applied for a job with the Trump-era Justice Department, raising the appearance of bias.

District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"Wildfires in western Canada are expected to create smoky conditions in the United States this week. Parts of the U.S. had unhealthy air in June from wildfires in other parts of Canada.

A group of young people in Montana won a landmark lawsuit on Monday when a judge ruled that the state’s failure to consider climate change when approving fossil fuel projects was unconstitutional.
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"The plaintiffs want the state to drop its residency requirement. Oregon and Vermont have already done so. Judy Govatos has heard that magical phrase “you’re in remission” twice, in 2015 and again in 2019. She had beaten back Stage 4 lymphoma with such aggressive chemotherapy and other treatments that at one point she grew too weak to stand, and relied on a wheelchair. She endured several hospitalizations, suffered infections and lost nearly 20 pounds. But she prevailed."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"As a founder of the San Francisco band It’s a Beautiful Day, he was at the center, if not in the forefront, of the Haight-Ashbury acid-rock explosion. David LaFlamme, who infused the psychedelic rock of the 1960s with the plaintive sounds of an electric violin as a founder of It’s a Beautiful Day, the ethereal San Francisco band whose breakout hit, “White Bird,” encapsulated the hippie-era longing for freedom, died on Aug. 6 in Santa Rosa, Calif. He was 82."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,A judge’s decision to limit how the administration can interact with platforms could chill the White House’s efforts to utilize and police big tech.

District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"The city’s $26 million contract with Talkspace makes mental health care very accessible. But some worry it is ‘a Band-Aid’ at a time of crisis. For the past month, New York City has been inviting teenagers to participate in one of the biggest experiments in the country aimed at helping struggling adolescents: a program offering free online therapy to all residents ages 13 to 17."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"Despite holding more than 700 votes this year, the House only managed to pass 27 bills that have made it into law, thanks to tiny majorities, divided government and a right wing bent on constraining government. In a year of divided government, when House Republicans were even divided against themselves, Congress was historically unproductive. The House has passed just 27 bills that were signed into law by President Biden. Still to come is the annual military policy bill that the House cleared for Mr. Biden last week but he has yet to sign."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"The administration’s “good neighbor” rule on cross-state pollution, meant to protect downwind states from harmful emissions, faces a legal challenge.

District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"A recent change in antitrust law made it easier for the singers to bypass big movie studios when seeking distribution for their concert films. Just before Taylor Swift’s concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” passed $100 million in global ticket presales this week, its distributor, AMC Entertainment, announced that it had struck a similar deal with Beyoncé for the singer’s Renaissance tour. Both projects follow tours that became cultural phenomena and pushed sales records, and the films are expected to be hits themselves."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"The court should embrace the art of judicial statecraft. A generation after the Supreme Court stepped into a disputed presidential election, America is experiencing a creeping sense of déjà vu.

Florida,2020,Q1,"Despite efforts by President Trump and others to reassure the public that tests are getting disseminated quickly, several states, doctors and patients complained that access was limited.

Florida,2020,Q1,"The sprawling Department of Veterans Affairs is legally designated as the nation’s backup health system and could prove vital in the pandemic. WASHINGTON — The Department of Veterans Affairs, legally designated as the backup health care system in national emergencies, is preparing to absorb the overflow of coronavirus patients from private hospitals if — or when — they become strained to the breaking point.

Florida,2020,Q2,"We need to get physician assistants off the sidelines and into the emergency rooms. Across the country, hospitals are overflowing with coronavirus patients, and health care workers are scrambling to keep up. Physician assistants are trained as generalists — but in several states, including Florida, the help they are able to provide is limited not by their ability but by strict supervision agreements with a specific physician. This administrative red tape creates barriers for hospitals in need of workers during an all-hands-on-deck crisis. In the above video, Kimberly Berggren, a physician assistant in Florida, implores Gov. Ron DeSantis to join states like New York and Michigan and remove restrictions in her state so hospitals can get the help they need."

In a pandemic landscape where big weddings still don’t make sense to many, the wedding that Angela Horan and Gary Bergstrom put on March 20 at their seven-acre property in Myakka, Fla., did to them, somehow. Though at the time, Floridians were being encouraged not to gather in groups of more than 10, Ms. Horan and Mr. Bergstrom said they knew most of their 300 guests had been vaccinated or had Covid antibodies. And given the magnitude of the hurdles they had scaled as a couple, they decided an extra-large celebration was worth the risk."

Florida,2023,Q3,"The loss of support for an AIDS relief program would signal to the rest of the world that it could no longer rely on the U.S. to defend its biggest accomplishments as a leader in global health. At the end of 2001, not long after George W. Bush became president, there were 40 million people across the globe living with H.I.V./AIDS, which was usually a death sentence for those who lacked access to treatment. Most people with H.I.V. lived on the continent of Africa, where 2.3 million died of AIDS that year. There were widespread estimates that 100 million worldwide would die of AIDS in the following 20 years if something wasn’t done to better distribute treatment."
Florida,2023,Q3,"The Kentucky Republican said he would finish his term as leader, which runs through 2024, and in the Senate, where he was elected to serve through 2026.

Florida,2023,Q3,"Two years in the community of Celebration, Fla., turned out to be a little too much Disney.

A couple wanted a new house in a slightly calmer area — but still with plenty of amusement."
Florida,2023,Q3,"Medical device makers have bankrolled a cottage industry of doctors and clinics that perform artery-clearing procedures that can lead to amputations. Kelly Hanna’s leg was amputated on a summer day in 2020, after a Michigan doctor who called himself the “leg saver” had damaged her arteries by snaking metal wires through them to clear away plaque."
Florida,2023,Q4,"Xavier Becerra, the health and human services secretary, suggested that states were doing far too little to make sure that children were not unfairly denied federal insurance. The Biden administration on Monday warned the governors of nine states of unusually high Medicaid coverage losses among children, suggesting that officials were failing to protect young, low-income Americans while winnowing the program’s rolls."
Florida,2023,Q4,"Children who have had WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit purée pouches should get a blood test, federal officials said. An investigation found that the purée had “extremely high concentrations of lead.” Federal health officials are warning parents and caregivers not to buy WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit purée pouches or feed them to their children because the product may contain elevated levels of lead."

Florida,2023,Q4,"Mark Grenon, 66, and three sons sold $1 million of an industrial bleach solution that they claimed to be a cure-all, prosecutors said. A Florida man and three sons who used a business masquerading as a church to sell more than $1 million of a deadly bleach solution that they claimed was a “miracle” cure for Covid-19 and other diseases were each sentenced on Friday to several years in prison, federal prosecutors in Miami said."
Florida,2023,Q4,"In an overwhelmingly Republican district, Mr. Gaetz is admired for shaking up the House, but he also has plenty of critics. He is polarizing in Washington and polarizing at home. And in both places these days, he is getting more attention than anyone might expect, given his lack of seniority and thin legislative record."
Florida,2023,Q4,"The strike at the truck manufacturer by 4,000 members of the United Automobile Workers comes in the middle of the union’s strikes at three large U.S. car companies. Nearly 4,000 members of the United Automobile Workers union went on strike against Mack Trucks on Monday after rejecting a tentative contract that union’s leaders had worked out with the company."
Florida,2023,Q4,"The senator faced calls to step down as her health declined, amid concerns about the effectiveness of an aging Senate. Over more than a half-century of public life, Senator Dianne Feinstein’s accomplishments rivaled those of anyone in the national arena: The 1994 assault weapons ban. The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on the use of torture. Her trailblazing example as a woman in an overwhelmingly male-dominated political landscape."
Florida,2023,Q4,"A child psychologist, he argued that behavioral therapy had to come first in addressing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, with drugs like Ritalin as a supplement. William E. Pelham Jr., a child psychologist who challenged how his field approached attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, arguing for a therapy-based regimen that used drugs like Ritalin and Adderall as an optional supplement, died on Oct. 21 in Miami. He was 75."
Florida,2023,Q4,"Is this really about policy, or is it personal? Donald Trump hasn’t talked much about policy in this election cycle, except for vague assertions that he’ll somehow bring back low unemployment and low inflation — which, by the way, has already happened. (Unemployment has been at or below 4 percent for almost two years. Thursday’s report on consumer spending showed the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of underlying inflation getting close to its 2 percent target.) Most of his energy seems to be devoted to the prospect of wreaking revenge on his political opponents, whom he promises to “root out” like “vermin.”"
Florida,2023,Q4,"Democratic candidates jumped on the story of a woman who left Texas for an abortion as a cautionary tale for voters, and Republicans were largely silent. The case of a Texas woman who sought a court-approved abortion but wound up leaving the state for the procedure is reigniting political arguments that have roiled elections for more than two years, placing Democrats on the offensive and illustrating Republicans’ continued lack of a unified policy response or clear strategy on how to talk about the issue."
