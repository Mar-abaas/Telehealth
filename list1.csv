Alabama,2020,Q1,"There is no such thing. Following last week’s argument in a Louisiana abortion case, the consensus among attentive Supreme Court-watchers is that the outcome depends on Chief Justice John Roberts, who seemed not to share Justice Samuel Alito’s visceral dislike of abortion clinics and his deep suspicion of doctors who work in them. I agree."
Alabama,2020,Q1,"Across the country, it’s mostly business as usual in the justice system. And that’s inviting the spread of the coronavirus. Across the country, only a small number of courts and justice systems appear to have significantly adjusted their procedures to guard against the coronavirus pandemic. And that is putting tens of thousands of people at risk for no good reason."
Alabama,2020,Q1,"The spending package dwarfs what the Trump administration requested to confront the outbreak.

Update: On Tuesday, a federal appeals court blocked Monday’s ruling, a move that allows authorities in Texas to resume carrying out their order that abortions have to be delayed during the cornavirus pandemic. Failure to comply, the state has said, could result in penalties of up to $1,000 or 180 days in jail. The Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents abortion clinics, said clinics in Texas were canceling appointments on Tuesday afternoon."
Alabama,2020,Q1,"Some tests distributed by the agency deliver “inconclusive” readings. The C.D.C. will need to ship new ingredients, further delaying results.

Alabama,2020,Q2,"Richard J. McGuire told the police that Discovery Island, an 11-acre zoological park with aromatic trees and walk-through aviaries that closed in 1999, looked like a “tropical paradise.” It had the makings of an adventure straight from Disney’s “Swiss Family Robinson” — being on an uninhabited island and living off the land."
Alabama,2020,Q2,"In large swaths of the U.S., people have a hard time reaching a hospital that offers the kind of inpatient care needed to treat the coronavirus. In large swaths of the U.S., people have a hard time reaching a hospital that offers the kind of inpatient care needed to treat the coronavirus."
Alabama,2020,Q2,"Inconsistent protocols, limited resources and a patchwork of decision making have led to an undercounting of people with the coronavirus who have died, health experts say. WASHINGTON — A coroner in Indiana wanted to know if the coronavirus had killed a man in early March, but said that her health department denied a test. Paramedics in New York City say that many patients who died at home were never tested for the coronavirus, even if they showed telltale signs of infection."

Alabama,2020,Q2,"Between the pandemic and the killings of George Floyd and others, the mental health of black people is floundering. Employers must address these issues head-on. When a video goes viral showing violence against a black person, the shock waves are felt throughout our community. Our social feeds show a mixture of outrage, despair and an overall sense of fatigue."
Alabama,2020,Q2,"Ace Speedway had defied the governor’s orders prohibiting large gatherings because of the pandemic. It can only reopen with a state-approved plan. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina has ordered an auto racing track in a rural part of the state to close after it staged events with packed stands, despite restrictions on gatherings, and became a flash point in the discussion on safely restarting sports."
Alabama,2020,Q2,"Even when racism doesn’t go viral, it’s still deadly. Imagine that no one had shot video of George Floyd being killed by the police in Minneapolis. There would have been a bland statement that he had died resisting arrest, and none of us would have heard of him."
Alabama,2020,Q2,"After failing to appear in court on traffic and other charges, a pregnant woman was detained overnight at a Montgomery, Ala., jail, where a coronavirus outbreak has occurred.

WASHINGTON — Dr. Francis S.

Alabama,2020,Q3,How a Tiny Crustacean Can Have a Huge Impact on Your Well-Being 
Alabama,2020,Q3,"In four rulings in a row, the court has refused to ease voting restrictions. For the fourth time since April, the Supreme Court this week made it harder for Americans to vote. The ruling, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, was part of “a trend of condoning disfranchisement.”"
Alabama,2020,Q3,"Health experts have been skeptical that such parties occur, and details of this case could not be independently confirmed.

Alabama,2020,Q3,"The health insurance group may pay $2.7 billion to resolve allegations that the chain blocked competition. The nation’s Blue Cross plans have reached a tentative $2.7 billion settlement in a federal lawsuit filed by their customers that accuses the group of engaging in a conspiracy to thwart competition among the individual companies, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions."
Alabama,2020,Q4,"A catastrophic sequence of decisions has blocked states from responding to the pandemic.

Alabama,2020,Q4,"Alabama’s immense resources and a newly developed Southeastern Conference policy paved the way for Saban to return to the field only days after he tested positive for the coronavirus. A private jet, the crimson “A” of the University of Alabama painted on its tail, lifted off from Tuscaloosa, Ala., around daybreak Saturday with extraordinary cargo: cellular debris collected from the nose of Nick Saban, the football coach."

Health officials say an influx of rapid, inexpensive tests is good for the country, but caution that they are struggling to count those who test positive."
Alabama,2020,Q4,College athletics can teach the right lesson by insisting that public health is more important than sports. Look no further than the storied Rose Bowl game to understand college football’s disingenuous and perilous posturing about the sanctity of its athletics programs while the coronavirus has ravaged the country and college campuses.
Alabama,2020,Q4,"As games are postponed and coronavirus outbreaks spike on campuses, nothing seems capable of stopping the juggernaut, regardless of the consequences. The news that Alabama Coach Nick Saban tested positive this week for the coronavirus gave an uppercut jolt to big-time college football, which is doing all it can to continue with its season — pandemic be damned."
Alabama,2020,Q4,"Many Black and Hispanic Americans mistrust government officials, and instead have turned to physicians they have long known. Like many Black and rural Americans, Denese Rankin, a 55-year-old retired bookkeeper and receptionist in Castleberry, Ala., did not want the Covid-19 vaccine."

Alabama,2021,Q1,"The president’s support for the rights of unionizing Amazon workers delighted political organizers in Alabama who are hoping to build long-term Democratic momentum in a reliably red state. BESSEMER, Ala. — The first time Darryl Richardson tried to start a union, he was 23 years old and virtually alone in the effort. It failed, he lost his job, and he remembers the lasting fears of other employees who worried they would suffer a similar fate."
Alabama,2021,Q1,"A Craftsman cottage in Montgomery, a converted church in Keene and a Greek Revival house in Quincy. This home is in the Old Cloverdale neighborhood, just east of the historic Garden District, a couple of blocks from the house where Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald lived briefly in the early 1930s. (It is now a museum.) Equally close are cafes, galleries, boutiques and one of the only full-service gas stations in town. Alabama State University is a third of a mile northeast; the state capitol is a mile and a half north; and the two-and-a-half-year-old National Memorial for Peace and Justice, better known as the Lynching Memorial, is about two miles northwest. The sellers, who have lived in the home for six years, replaced the roof in 2016."
Alabama,2021,Q1,"The immediate winner of college football’s national championship was easy to discern by the crowds after the game. The health consequences are yet to be seen. Alabama had a lot to celebrate, so football fans in Tuscaloosa did just that: tossing beer bottles, banners and masks; climbing trees, light posts and one another."
Alabama,2021,Q1,"The east parking lot at Hard Rock Stadium has been a virus testing facility since March, closing for games for the N.F.L.’s Miami Dolphins and the University of Miami football teams. It also shut down for the Orange Bowl, though it is typically open seven days a week.

Alabama,2021,Q1,"The more transmissible and possibly more lethal B.1.1.7 variant already accounts for an estimated 20 percent of the nation’s infections. States have continued steadily lifting restrictions, despite warnings from top federal health officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci that new coronavirus cases in the United States have plateaued at a very high level after their drastic drop has stalled, and that the country urgently needed to contain the spread of more transmissible variants."
Alabama,2021,Q1,"More than 200,000 have used a special enrollment period to sign up for health insurance under the act, while Alabama and Wyoming eye the law’s Medicaid expansion.

Four of the most fabled programs in college football — Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State and Notre Dame — still have hopes of winning the championship in one of the most chaotic, uncertain, week-to-week seasons in the sport’s history."
Alabama,2021,Q2,"One legal expert said that repealing the laws might have been easier before the pandemic, when masks were not such a political lightning rod. Long before the pandemic arrived on American shores, there were debates over the politics of mask wearing. More than a dozen states have laws barring people from covering their faces in public, most of them ordinances passed to deter the Ku Klux Klan hate group."
Alabama,2021,Q2,"Half of American adults have received at least one shot of the coronavirus vaccine. Now comes the hard part: persuading the other half to get it. WASHINGTON — Now that President Biden has met his goal to have all adults eligible for the coronavirus vaccine, health officials around the country are hitting what appears to be a soft ceiling: More than half the nation’s adults have received at least one dose, but it is going to take hard work — and some creative changes in strategy — to convince the rest."
Alabama,2021,Q2,"One in five in that age group, mostly in the South, haven’t received a single dose, increasing the risk of virus outbreaks there. There are 11 states in the United States where at least 20 percent of older adults still haven’t received a Covid shot, potentially putting the recovery there at risk."
Alabama,2021,Q2,"Blues, silhouettes, two-dimensional figures at play. This artist created mystical experiences from whatever scraps he could find. Many of the works by the Alabama artist Bill Traylor, stark silhouette drawings with striking, significant blocks of color, are drawn on scraps of paper, or someone else’s stationery — things like that. This wasn’t Traylor’s way of making a postmodern statement; he was just using the art supplies he had."
Alabama,2021,Q2,A labor battle in Alabama is a referendum on Amazon’s strategy. It’s hard to decide who is having a better troll moment on Twitter this week: Jeff Bezos or Lil Nas X.

Alabama,2021,Q2,"New England is surging ahead of the national average while the South is lagging behind. Almost half of Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. But the U.S. vaccination story varies widely across regions, with New England surging ahead of the national average and much of the South lagging far behind."
Alabama,2021,Q2,Even as the country is on track to reach the president's national target — at least 70 percent of adults with one dose by July 4 — 30 states probably will not. Even as the country is on track to reach the president's national target — at least 70 percent of adults with one dose by July 4 — 30 states probably will not.
Alabama,2021,Q2,"Efforts to speed up vaccinations have diverted resources from screening, and fewer people seem to seek out a test unless they are ill. Declines in coronavirus testing in many states in the South and the Great Plains are making it harder to know just how widely the virus may be spreading in those states, even as restrictions are lifted and residents ease back into daily life, experts say."
Alabama,2021,Q2,"Since March 2020, New York Times reporters have tracked every known coronavirus case in every correctional setting in the nation. More than 2,700 inmates have died.

That average is higher than in any previous surge except last winter’s, before most Americans were eligible to get vaccinated."
Alabama,2021,Q3,"A second union vote may be held at an Alabama warehouse, and new tactics by the Teamsters and other groups aim to pressure Amazon across the country. Since the start of the pandemic, Amazon has ramped up its hiring, bringing on hundreds of thousands of employees worldwide. But challenges to the company’s labor practices are growing quickly, too."

Alabama,2021,Q3,"At one time the N.F.L.’s highest-paid defensive player, he left the league after six seasons and fell into a spiral of addiction, homelessness and desolation. In N.F.L. parlance, Keith McCants was a “can’t miss.” A relentless and powerful athlete, he was a first-team all-American linebacker at Alabama and drafted fourth overall in 1990 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His success seemingly guaranteed, the team made him the highest-paid defensive player in the league."
Alabama,2021,Q3,"It’s more than “hesitancy” that stops New Yorkers from getting vaccinated. Many communities have deep-seated doubts, and the Health Department is running out of ideas. If you were really scared of something — a fear founded on rumor and history, that you could get sick and possibly die, lose your ability to have children, alter your DNA or be left at the mercy of pernicious government surveillance — would you do it anyway, for the prospect of a membership to the Public Theater? Or a free glazed doughnut at Krispy Kreme?"

Alabama,2021,Q3,"The older cohort had a head start on getting immunized against Covid-19, but too many remain unprotected, experts say.

Alabama,2021,Q3,"Cases are starting to fall in some hard-hit Southern states, but nearly half of Americans are not fully vaccinated, allowing the Delta variant to persist.

Alabama,2021,Q3,"The share of Hispanic people in the U.S. who reported receiving at least one dose of vaccine shot up from July to September, and now exceeds that of non-Hispanic white people.

Alabama,2021,Q4,"The N.F.L. has very little wiggle room in its regular season and playoffs. And universities are reshuffling their college basketball teams as the College Football Playoff and bowl games near. The N.F.L. on Friday postponed three games that were slated for this weekend, the latest juggling of sports schedules as scores of college and professional athletes and coaches have tested positive for the coronavirus in the pandemic’s latest surge."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"Public health experts fear that the highly contagious variant cannot be stopped without harsh measures that the public will no longer tolerate. Even as President Biden on Tuesday outlined new plans for battling the highly contagious Omicron variant, public health experts warned that the measures would not be sufficient to prevent a grim rise in infections and hospitalizations over the next few weeks."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"As many Americans plan larger celebrations this year, the immunization status of dinner guests is becoming a topic of conversation, concern and conflict. For the first time in two years, Tim Wyatt is hosting a Thanksgiving feast at his home in Birmingham, Ala. Along with the traditional turkey, Mr. Wyatt will spend days preparing his slow-roasted pork shoulder with Alabama white sauce. His wife, Nancy Wyatt, will cook all of her enticing side dishes, like sour cream mini-muffins and sweet potato casserole with sage butter."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"The number of eligible people still weighing whether to get a Covid vaccine has sharply dwindled, leaving an unvaccinated population that is mostly hard-core refusers. Vaccinated people have been burning up the phone lines at the community health center in rural Franklin, La., clamoring for the newly authorized Covid booster shot."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"Glimpses of a post-Roe world in Oklahoma.  Brittney Poolaw, then 19 years old, showed up at the Comanche County Memorial Hospital in Oklahoma last year after suffering a miscarriage at home. She had been about 17 weeks pregnant. According to an affidavit from a police detective who interviewed her, she admitted to hospital staff that she had recently used both methamphetamine and marijuana."
Alabama,2021,Q4,"Finger pointing is pointless, divisive and dumb.  Over the summer, as Covid cases started rising from their midyear lows, it became popular to blame Republicans for fueling the pandemic. The argument was that Covid had become a red-state scourge because of lower rates of mask-wearing and vaccination — along with high doses of vaccine misinformation — in places that went heavily for Donald Trump."
Alabama,2021,Q4,A court has blocked enforcement of President Biden’s executive order that had instructed federal contractors to require coronavirus vaccines for employees.

Alabama,2022,Q1,"Biden’s vaccine mandates must remain intact. On Friday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments about two of the Biden administration’s emergency Covid-19 regulations, including a vaccine or test mandate for large employers and a vaccine requirement for some health workers. At stake in the cases, brought by business groups and Republican-led states, is not only the future of the pandemic but also the federal government’s capacity to respond to continuing and future health threats."
Alabama,2022,Q1,"Recent huddles among the sport’s leaders have shown how much television drives their thinking. INDIANAPOLIS — Freezing rain had turned the downtown sidewalks here into granite-hard slip-and-slide tracks. A downtown concert stage and beer garden sat vacant, a dance and light drone show was canceled, and getting a restaurant table — even a socially distant one — was no problem at all on Saturday night."
Alabama,2022,Q1,"F.D.A. inspectors said that a fumigation of the West Memphis, Ark., distribution center last month revealed more than 1,100 dead rodents. A far-reaching recall has been issued for stores in six states.

In the cities that were among the first to experience rapid rises in Covid cases due to Omicron, serious outcomes including I.C.U. stays and deaths are following case curves upward."
Alabama,2022,Q1,"The growing normalcy divide within liberal America. The line between zealous Covid precautions and a mask-optional existence does not run simply between red and blue America, between areas that voted for Joe Biden and those that voted for Donald Trump. As Park MacDougald pointed out in a recent essay for the online magazine UnHerd, if you’re a New York City resident, you can experience two completely different realities just by traveling the short distance from the posher parts of Brooklyn to where he lives in Queens — passing from a world of ubiquitous N95s and careful checking of vaccine cards to a world where masking is maybe a 50 percent proposition and, outside of hipster establishments, the vaccine-pass rules are “almost totally unenforced.”"
Alabama,2022,Q1,"We look at Omicron’s toll in New York and Seattle, two cities with timely data. Some of the timeliest data on Covid-19 outcomes by vaccination status comes from New York City and the Seattle area, and the two are telling a consistent story."

Alabama,2022,Q1,"The Supreme Court will hear from two convicted pill mill doctors in cases that could have significant implications for physicians’ latitude to prescribe addictive painkillers. For years, Dr. Xiulu Ruan was one of the nation’s top prescribers of quick-release fentanyl drugs. The medicines were approved only for severe breakthrough pain in cancer patients, but Dr. Ruan dispensed them almost exclusively for more common ailments: neck aches, back and joint pain. According to the Department of Justice, he and his partner wrote almost 300,000 prescriptions for controlled substances from 2011 to 2015, filled through the doctors’ own pharmacy in Mobile, Ala. Dr. Ruan often signed prescriptions without seeing patients, prosecutors said."
Alabama,2022,Q2,"Most of the state abortion prohibitions that would go into effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned do not contain carve-outs that were once widely supported by abortion opponents.

Alabama,2022,Q2,"The president’s call came as Republicans worried that the aid was harming U.S. military readiness and progressives fretted over his stalled domestic agenda.

Alabama,2022,Q2,"I wrote the “Handbook for a Post-Roe America.” It’s time to put it into practice. In February 2021, I uprooted my husband, three children and two cats from our longtime home to move across the country to a house we had only seen on FaceTime, in a city we only knew from college football. I did this because I believe that everyone who supports abortion rights must do what they’re able to to keep abortion accessible for those who have the least resources to get one."

Alabama,2022,Q2,"Health officials are exploring the possibility that a common adenovirus might be responsible for the unexplained cases, which remain rare.

In the United States, 180 cases and six deaths have now been reported, the agency said at a news briefing on Friday."
Alabama,2022,Q2,"The agency stressed that the disease was still very rare in children and that a cause had not been determined.

Alabama,2022,Q3,"Climate has received most of the attention. But the Senate bill brings big changes to health care, too. The climate provisions in the bill that the Senate passed this weekend are likely to be more consequential than anything else in the bill.

That means that many people who live in affected regions will need to be especially vigilant about keeping themselves safe and healthy."
Alabama,2022,Q4,"Vote because abortion matters. Despite Republican‌ assurances that their draconian abortion bans wouldn’t hurt women, a flood of heart-wrenching accounts from across the country prove otherwise. Yet even with that outpouring of stories, plus polls showing broad opposition to the bans and an increase in women registering to vote, it’s still unclear if the issue will be the deciding factor for voters in the midterm elections on Tuesday."
Alabama,2022,Q4,"The bill, which passed the Senate on Thursday, now heads to President Biden’s desk for his signature.

WASHINGTON — Billions of dollars in emergency aid to war-torn Ukraine and communities ravaged by natural disasters. A bipartisan proposal to overhaul the archaic law at the heart of former President Donald J. Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election. And a divisive oceanic policy that will change federal protections for whales in an effort to protect the lobster industry in Maine."
Alabama,2022,Q4,"The legislation, which would fund the government through September, would significantly increase federal spending and provide billions of dollars in emergency aid.

Alabama,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Alabama,2023,Q2,"Experiments using mice found a malfunction in adult stem cells that offers insights into why we turn into silver foxes and vixens. Many of the signs of aging are invisible, slow, and subtle — changes in cell division capacity, cardiac output and kidney function don’t exactly show up in the mirror. But gray hairs are one of the most obvious clues that the body isn’t working like it used to."
Alabama,2023,Q2,"A current list of clinics that had closed, altered services or relocated didn’t exist — so two Times reporters made one.

Alabama,2023,Q2,"“Say Anarcha” is J.C. Hallman’s meticulous biography of the enslaved woman who suffered unimaginable horrors at the hands of a lauded doctor. Medical journals are filled with untold stories. We may be able to imagine a moment — the pain of a biopsy, the devastation of a cancer recurrence. But in a research paper, these experiences are necessarily reduced, by the scientific method and privacy concerns, to numbers. Responders and non-responders. Recurrence and no recurrence. Mortality and survival. Rarely, one name leaps at us from the medical literature and demands a personal reckoning. And one such name is Anarcha."
Alabama,2023,Q2,"The way health care providers negotiate drug prices has put the squeeze on manufacturers. The Times reported last month that drug shortages in the United States are approaching record levels, with thousands of patients facing delays in getting cancer treatments, a drug that reverses lead poisoning, a sterile fluid needed to stop the heart for bypass surgery and antibiotics for strep throat, among many other medicines. One doctor described the shortages as a national health emergency."

Alabama,2023,Q3,"The industry is facing challenges, but in western Massachusetts the quality of the works is as rich as ever, our critic writes. Suddenly, out of the darkness, came one of the most thrilling sounds an audience can make: a collective gasp. This is how you know that the crowd is rapt, that the storytelling has taken hold. And so it had the other night during a performance of “Blues for an Alabama Sky” at Barrington Stage Company, where a different plot twist elicited another welcome noise: a mid-scene eruption of delighted applause. Humans can be a lot of fun to see a show with."
Alabama,2023,Q3,"The state’s law, which bans medication and surgeries that aid in gender transition for minors not currently receiving such care, will go into effect on Monday. A state judge in Missouri on Friday denied a request to temporarily block a state law passed this year that restricts gender-related medical treatments for minors. The ruling was issued by Missouri Circuit Court Judge Steven Ohmer, three days before the ban is set to go into effect. A legal challenge to the ban brought by civil rights groups is ongoing."

Alabama,2023,Q3,"The Alabama Republican’s bid to force the Pentagon to drop a policy ensuring access to abortion services for personnel could leave the Joint Chiefs of Staff with more temporary occupants than it has ever faced. A lone Senate Republican’s bid to reverse a Pentagon policy ensuring abortion access for service members is delaying the smooth transfer of power at the highest echelons of the armed forces, including in the ranks of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a monthslong partisan dispute over social policy drags on."
Alabama,2023,Q3,"It figured prominently in viral footage of a brawl, where it was used as a blunt instrument. So why is the humble folding chair now turning up on T-shirts, earrings and at least one tattoo? Within hours of a fight breaking out on an Alabama riverfront this month, images and video clips from the brawl began to ricochet online. Then came the memes. After that, it wasn’t long until the merchandise started to appear."
Alabama,2023,Q3,"Senator Chuck Schumer’s move to clear the way for the confirmation of three top generals left unanswered the question of what would happen to hundreds of other military promotions. The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly confirmed Gen. Randy George of the Army and Gen. Eric Smith of the Marines as the chiefs of staff of their respective services, circumventing a single senator’s blockade against senior military promotions but leaving hundreds more still in limbo."
Alabama,2023,Q3,"Algorithmic recommendations aren’t just bad for kids’ mental health; they’re taking away the journey of discovery that comes with being human. Kids are even more in the bag of social media companies than we think. So many of them have ceded their online autonomy so fully to their phones that they even balk at the idea of searching the internet — for them, the only acceptable online environment is one customized by big tech algorithms, which feed them customized content."
Alabama,2023,Q3,"President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate some drug prices, a change that the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have opposed for decades. As he heads toward a re-election campaign next year, President Biden is betting that his success in pushing for policies intended to lower health care costs for millions of Americans will be rewarded by voters at the ballot box."

He was 91."
Alabama,2023,Q4,"Transgender minors in the state will be able to receive gender transition care for now, while the challenge against the state ban proceeds.

Alabama,2023,Q4,"Under pressure from senators in both parties, the Alabama Republican allowed more than 400 promotions to move forward, saying he would continue to block only the most senior positions. Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, on Tuesday lifted his blockade of nearly all the military promotions he had delayed for almost a year in protest of a Pentagon policy ensuring abortion access for service members, saying he would continue to hold up only the most senior generals."
Alabama,2023,Q4,"Mississippi has long had high childhood immunization rates, but a federal judge has ordered the state to allow parents to opt out on religious grounds. For more than 40 years, Mississippi had one of the strictest school vaccination requirements in the nation, and its high childhood immunization rates have been a source of pride. But in July, the state began excusing children from vaccination if their parents cited religious objections, after a federal judge sided with a “medical freedom” group."
Alabama,2023,Q4,"They propose questions designed to test the candidates on guns and crime, foreign wars and health care. Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate, held in Tuscaloosa, Ala., will feature just four candidates — Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and Chris Christie — sparring over everything from abortion to Israel to former President Donald Trump. When we asked Times Opinion columnists and contributors what they would ask the candidates if they were moderating the debate, they came back to us with questions designed to test them on guns and crime, foreign wars and health care — exposing where the field stands on, say, military aid for Ukraine or a draconian state abortion ban. But above all, what they wanted to see was the moderators needling the candidates into taking a strong stance on the former president. Here are the responses:"
Alabama,2023,Q4,"A child psychologist, he argued that behavioral therapy had to come first in addressing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, with drugs like Ritalin as a supplement. William E. Pelham Jr., a child psychologist who challenged how his field approached attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, arguing for a therapy-based regimen that used drugs like Ritalin and Adderall as an optional supplement, died on Oct. 21 in Miami. He was 75."
Alabama,2023,Q4,"The $886 billion legislation is the product of bipartisan negotiations between the House and Senate in which right-wing restrictions on abortion, transgender care and diversity initiatives were jettisoned. The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed an $886 billion defense bill that would set Pentagon policy and provide a 5.2 percent pay raise for military personnel, defying the demands of Republicans who failed to attach a raft of deeply partisan restrictions on abortion, transgender care and diversity initiatives."

Alabama,2024,Q1,The Alabama Supreme Court ruled this month that frozen embryos are children. A surprise ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court has halted fertility treatments across the state and sent a shock wave through the world of reproductive health.
Alabama,2024,Q1,"Two major fertility clinics said they were moving to resume treatments quickly, though legal experts cautioned that state constitutional challenges may still arise. Alabama lawmakers passed legislation on Wednesday to shield in vitro fertilization providers from civil and criminal liability, capping off their scramble to allow the fertility treatment after a State Supreme Court ruling found that frozen embryos should be considered children."
Alabama,2024,Q1,"Hours after the governor signed a law that offers legal protections to clinics and doctors performing I.V.F. procedures, at least one clinic resumed embryo transfers.

Alabama,2024,Q1,"Also, President Biden canceled $1.2 billion in student loan debt. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. The University of Alabama at Birmingham health system, which includes the state’s largest hospital, announced today that it would pause in vitro fertilization treatments after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos in test tubes should be considered children."
Alabama,2024,Q1,"Fertility clinics are routinely sued by patients for errors that destroy embryos, as happened in Alabama. An effort to define them legally as “unborn children” has raised the stakes. To the fertility patients whose embryos were destroyed at an Alabama clinic, the circumstances must have been shocking. Somehow, a patient in the hospital housing the clinic had wandered into a storage room, pulled the embryos from a tank of liquid nitrogen, and then dropped them on the floor — probably because the tank was kept at minus 360 degrees."
Alabama,2024,Q1,"Many suffered setbacks after the State Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos were children. “Someone else’s opinion changed my future,” one woman said. Leelee Ray and her husband, Austin, have been trying to have a baby for six years, through insemination procedures, two egg retrievals, four embryo transfers, an ectopic pregnancy that could have been deadly and eight miscarriages."
Alabama,2024,Q2,"The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among college students rose to 7.5 percent in 2022, more than double the rate five years earlier, researchers found.

Alabama,2024,Q2,"The expansion would extend largely free health coverage to 200,000 more low-income adults. But hurdles remain, including a likely veto by Gov. Tate Reeves.

Alabama,2024,Q2,"Neither side of the abortion divide would probably design the exact candidate they have in 2024. In the summer of 2019, as a crowded Democratic primary was picking up speed, Joe Biden was on the defensive, pummeled by abortion-rights groups and his opponents for his support of the Hyde Amendment, a measure that prohibits the use of federal funds for most abortions."
Alabama,2024,Q2,"As Southern states reconsider Medicaid expansion, Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas is pushing her own plan meant to appeal to conservatives. So far, success has been elusive. As lawmakers in a nearby hearing room debated last month whether to support her legislation to expand Medicaid, Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas dared the state’s Republican House speaker to hold a vote."
Alabama,2024,Q2,Who is driving up drug costs for millions of people? You probably already know some of the reasons prescription drugs are so expensive. Drugmakers charge as much as the market will bear. Health insurers and the government haven’t reined in prices.
Alabama,2024,Q3,"Democrats brought up the measure again to highlight Republican opposition to abortion rights and make the case to voters that the G.O.P. stance threatens access to reproductive health care. Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked an election-season bid by Democrats to advance legislation that would guarantee federal protections and insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization treatments, the second time in three months that the G.O.P. has thwarted the broadly popular measure."

Alabama,2024,Q3,"It’s hydrating, to start. Here’s what else experts had to say about this warm-weather treat — along with some refreshing recipes. Watermelon is the fruit of summer. In the United States, it’s more popular than cantaloupe, honeydew and all other melons combined."
Alabama,2024,Q3,"Kamala Harris should show voters what Donald Trump could do in a second term. Protecting reproductive rights is one of Democrats’ strongest issues, and their ability to capitalize on it may decide a tight election. Chances are even better now with Kamala Harris, a candidate known for her unapologetic positions on the issue, at the top of the ticket."
Alabama,2024,Q3,"The Democratic senator has long pressed to safeguard the fertility treatment she used to conceive her children, which has now been thrust into the political conversation. When Senator Tammy Duckworth put off having children to prioritize her military career, the risk of losing her fertility because of combat injuries never crossed her mind."

Alabama,2024,Q3,"Though the president’s role is mostly ceremonial, Halla Tómasdóttir said that she would seek to raise “the right questions” and bring attention to critical health issues. Seven-year-old Halla Tómasdóttir was confused on her mother’s birthday in 1975. Her mother and aunts weren’t in the kitchen as usual, instead directing their husbands and brothers to do the work.

Alaska,2022,Q1,"The action aims to enhance American production of crucial materials for electric vehicles, defense systems and other technologies.

Alaska,2022,Q1,"Researchers worked out which receptors in your nose detect particular scent molecules, and found evidence of evolutionary change in some of these genes. When you take a whiff of something, odor molecules sail inside your nose where they bind to proteins — called olfactory receptors — on cells that line your nasal cavity. These receptors trigger signals that your brain interprets as one or many smells."
Alaska,2022,Q2,"In an unusual step, the mother of Lee Michael Pahe, who was found dead in July 2021, made a plea on the radio in her language, seeking information about her son’s death. The F.B.I. started airing a radio ad last week seeking information about the fatal shooting of a man in Naschitti, N.M., within the Navajo Nation."
Alaska,2022,Q2,"In recent weeks, travelers on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have endured long lines at airports, flight delays or cancellations, and plenty of frustration. Is this the new normal? Arriving at London’s Gatwick Airport for his easyJet flight to Malaga, Spain, with his wife and 12-year-old daughter on April 4, Alasdair Crawley said it was like walking into the mayhem of the aftermath of a soccer game. The 49-year-old plumber from East London described long unruly lines of angry passengers trying to determine the status of their flights and families sprawled out across the floor eating, drinking and sleeping to get through long delays."
Alaska,2022,Q2,"In the shadow of the iconic Denali peak in Alaska, a family bikes over the next rise and into the great unknown. My younger son was 8 months old, his brother almost 3, when we set out on our first backcountry adventure as a family, a combined cycling and camping trip in Alaska’s Denali National Park. We’d driven several hours north from Anchorage and began pedaling toward the unknown, which I’ve since come to recognize as the only reliable destination when traveling with kids. High above the muted tundra stood the tallest peak in North America, and a stunningly beautiful backdrop for a bike ride. In the foreground, nestled among sleeping bags and down coats, were two boys in a bicycle trailer, their forms as small as the mountains were big."
Alaska,2022,Q2,"The nation’s largest airlines dropped the requirement within hours of the ruling, but New York’s M.T.A. said its passengers must still wear a mask for now.

Alaska,2022,Q2,"Yes, if women are required to go through the ultimate stress test, their liberty is curtailed. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about Alexandra of Denmark, Great Britain’s queen from 1901 to 1910. Called “Alix” by her loved ones, she was the wife of King Edward VII, the notoriously promiscuous son of Queen Victoria, called “the playboy prince” by the biographer Jane Ridley."
Alaska,2022,Q2,"This year’s outbreak of the H5N1 virus has resulted in the deaths of nearly 400,000 wild birds worldwide. Scientists are studying the pathways of contagion among species. A great black-backed gull migrating from Europe to Eastern Canada last winter may have been the first carrier to North America of the deadly strain of avian influenza that has killed tens of millions of domestic poultry and devastated wild bird populations."
Alaska,2022,Q2,"Abortion rights advocates filed lawsuits to halt or delay bans on abortion in some states, with judges in Louisiana and Utah temporarily blocking new laws. SACRAMENTO — The battle over abortion shifted to the states on Monday as a weekend of furious protest and prayerful thanksgiving in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade reversal gave way to a coast-to-coast wave of lawsuits, legislation and pitched political fights. "
Alaska,2022,Q2,"Soaring rates were driven largely by gun-related homicides, which rose 35 percent from 2019 to 2020.

Alaska,2022,Q3,"The cap for private insurers was widely viewed as a violation of the strict budgetary rules that govern the reconciliation process Democrats are using to fast-track the package. Senate Republicans on Sunday forced the removal of a Democratic proposal that would have capped insulin prices at $35 for private insurers, even as seven Republicans joined all 50 members of the Democratic caucus in an effort to preserve the provision in the climate, tax and health care spending bill."
Alaska,2022,Q3,"The party is turning against a political commitment to fairness. One of the recurring points I make in my column is that the Republican Party, from the most junior state lawmaker to senators in Washington, has turned against many of the hallmarks of a functional political system, including a commitment to fairness and following the process. There are almost always new examples of Republican politicians rejecting any result or rule that doesn’t favor their interests, and this week we have two."
Alaska,2022,Q3,"The coronavirus revealed flaws in the nation’s pandemic plans. The spread of monkeypox shows that the problems remain deeply entrenched. If it wasn’t clear enough during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become obvious during the monkeypox outbreak: The United States, among the richest, most advanced nations in the world, remains wholly unprepared to combat new pathogens."
Alaska,2022,Q3,"Swimmers often worry about attacks by certain marine predators. But beware the bite of a more common animal. In the wild, is a human more likely to survive an encounter with an orca or a great white shark?"
Alaska,2022,Q3,"Four senators, two Democrats and two Republicans, joined forces to introduce legislation to guarantee abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned. But the bill has little chance of advancing. WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senators released a bill on Monday that would create a federal baseline for abortion access, the first bipartisan legislative effort on the issue since the Supreme Court struck down the Roe v. Wade ruling that established abortion rights nationwide."
Alaska,2022,Q3,"Major data gaps are undercutting the country’s ability to respond to outbreaks. Welcome to the Virus Briefing, your comprehensive guide to the latest news and expert analysis on the coronavirus pandemic and other outbreaks."
Alaska,2022,Q3,"A look at the latest results from last night’s primaries, and their larger meaning for the Republican Party. Last night offered the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s continued influence over the Republican Party. In today’s newsletter, we’ll give you the results and also offer some larger perspective on the overall success rate of Trump’s endorsements this year."
Alaska,2022,Q3,"Federal officials are not relying on an established system to distribute the vaccine, slowing immunizations and burdening local health departments, critics say. Roughly 5,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine intended for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., left the national stockpile’s warehouse in Olive Branch, Miss., on July 19. They somehow ended up in Oklahoma."
Alaska,2022,Q3,"Democrats in Congress are under pressure to act after the Supreme Court’s decision. But with Republicans and at least one Democrat opposed in the Senate, the measures are all but certain to fail. WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress, under pressure to take quick action in response to the Supreme Court’s decision striking down abortion rights, are planning to hold votes this week on legislation that seeks to preserve access to abortions in the post-Roe v. Wade era."

Alaska,2022,Q4,"Now experts are calling for walkable communities, improved housing, and access to health care and better food, particularly in minority communities. Over the past 50 years, medical advances have led to a more sophisticated understanding of the causes of Type 2 diabetes and to an abundance of new tools for managing it. But better treatments have done little to stem the rise of the disease."
Alaska,2022,Q4,"A new motion argues that lifting the Covid-19 policy next month will open the door to a surge of migrants in their states. Fifteen states have intervened to try to keep in place a pandemic-related policy that allows the government to swiftly expel migrants arriving from Mexico, a prelude to Republican plans to push new security measures on the southern border."
Alaska,2022,Q4,"The increases in homicides were particularly stark among Black and Hispanic men, while suicides involving firearms rose among all adults. Homicides and suicides involving guns, which soared in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, continued rising in 2021, reaching the highest rates in three decades, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday."
Alaska,2022,Q4,"All of my years as an organizer have taught me to channel that anger into action, and that in itself is a discipline of hope. Imagine what it’s like to live in a state of perpetual uncertainty — at any moment you could lose your job because you no longer have the right to work legally. Picture families ripped apart — a mother sent back to a country she barely remembers, forced to leave her child behind. What would you do if the teachers, doctors and nurses in your community were suddenly barred from entering your children’s classrooms or treating your loved ones?"
Alaska,2022,Q4,"A swarm of new subvariants are gaining ground in the U.S. ahead of winter. Several new Omicron subvariants have been steadily gaining ground in the U.S., setting off alarm bells ahead of fall and winter, when experts say we can expect to see another Covid surge."
Alaska,2022,Q4,"The first lady said she had once helped a friend recover from an abortion before there was a constitutional right to the procedure. “Women will not let this country go backwards,” she said. Jill Biden, the first lady, said on Friday that she had once helped a friend recover from an abortion before there was a constitutional right to the procedure, evoking the issue in deeply personal terms at a political fund-raiser as she warned of further restrictions from “extremist Republicans.”"
Alaska,2022,Q4,"They face threats around the world and must be protected. The Congo Basin’s Cuvette Centrale, the world’s largest complex of tropical peatlands, covers an area slightly larger than the state of New York and stores the equivalent of three years of global carbon dioxide emissions. Like other peatlands around the world, it is a potential carbon bomb. When disturbed, these swampy freshwater landscapes unleash their carbon, trapping ever more heat in the atmosphere and intensifying global warming."
Alaska,2022,Q4,"The bill, which would provide nearly $50 billion in aid to Ukraine, now heads to the House for a vote where it is expected to pass before being sent to President Biden. WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday approved a roughly $1.7 trillion spending package that would fund the federal government into next fall and send another round of financial assistance to Kyiv, a day after lawmakers welcomed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to Capitol Hill."

Bush administration."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"Scientists say alarming declines at the southern end of the fishes’ range may be a sign of what’s to come as waters warm farther north. This week, officials are expected to shut down all commercial and recreational salmon fishing off California for 2023. Much will be canceled off neighboring Oregon, too."
Alaska,2023,Q2,The group discusses Biden’s job performance and a potential Biden-Trump rematch. The group discusses Biden’s job performance and a potential Biden-Trump rematch.
Alaska,2023,Q2,"When Covid arrived, partisanship had little to do with how officials responded. I’d like to tell you a story about the pandemic, one that may sound so gauzily hopeful, it would qualify today as a public health fairy tale."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"When coverage upsets them, towns and counties are revoking newspapers’ lucrative contracts to print public notices. Two of the most powerful women in the village of Delhi in central New York sat face to face in a brick building on Main Street for what would become a fight over the First Amendment."
Alaska,2023,Q2,Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)
Alaska,2023,Q2,"Senator Joe Manchin III, the conservative West Virginia Democrat who faces re-election next year and is flirting with a presidential run, has threatened to repeal the measure he helped write. Ever since Senator Joe Manchin III, the conservative West Virginia Democrat, cast the crucial vote last year for the Inflation Reduction Act, delivering President Biden his biggest legislative victory to date, the bill has weighed him down politically."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"The former prosecutor was chosen for his experience in bringing high-stakes cases against politicians in the United States and abroad. Jack Smith, appointed in November to investigate former President Donald J. Trump, is a hard-driving, flinty veteran Justice Department prosecutor chosen for his experience in bringing high-stakes cases against politicians in the United States and abroad."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"San Francisco has proposed the nation’s most ambitious reparations plan, including $5 million cash payments and housing aid that aims to bring people back. SAN FRANCISCO — Standing at the stoop of her childhood home — a slim but stately Victorian shaded by an evergreen pear tree — Lynette Mackey pulled up a photo of a family gathering from nearly 50 years ago. The men were all in suits, the women in skirts. Ms. Mackey, a teenager in red bell bottoms, stretched her arms wide and had a beaming smile."
Alaska,2023,Q2,"What should we make of the role that abortion played in both the Chicago and Wisconsin elections this week? The elections this week in Chicago and Wisconsin were different in many ways. One was for mayor, the other for a state Supreme Court seat. One was in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, the other in a closely divided swing state."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"Thirty years of progress in decreasing drowning deaths in the United States appears to have plateaued, and disparities in deaths among some racial groups have worsened. Yadira Salcedo was born in Mexico to parents who did not know how to swim. As a child, she nearly drowned when she waded too deep in a backyard pool."
Alaska,2023,Q3,59 percent of voters sided with young activists in a referendum. Ecuador voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to halt oil drilling in one of the most biodiverse places on earth.
Alaska,2023,Q3,"The directive is intended to embed the cost of climate change into all federal agencies. But it is not legally binding and could come with legal and logistical challenges. A directive issued on Thursday by the Biden administration would, for the first time, have federal agencies consider the economic damage caused by climate change when deciding what kinds of vehicles, equipment and goods to buy."
Alaska,2023,Q3,Have you been paying attention to the news recently? See how many of these 10 questions you can get right. Have you been paying attention to the news recently? See how many of these 10 questions you can get right.
Alaska,2023,Q3,"How hot is it? No single temperature reading can capture the nation’s misery, so we’ve assembled a lot of figures to put the oppressive heat in context. All signs indicate that this will be one of the hottest summers on record, as a heat wave scorches the Northern Hemisphere. Large portions of the United States are sweating through oppressive conditions that show no signs of easing, accompanied by a growing death toll."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"Senator Chuck Schumer’s move to clear the way for the confirmation of three top generals left unanswered the question of what would happen to hundreds of other military promotions. The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly confirmed Gen. Randy George of the Army and Gen. Eric Smith of the Marines as the chiefs of staff of their respective services, circumventing a single senator’s blockade against senior military promotions but leaving hundreds more still in limbo."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, after the Supreme Court’s ruling. After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year, it looked like the number of abortions would soon plummet across the country. But new estimates suggest that has not happened. The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, nationwide since 2020, our colleagues Amy Schoenfeld Walker and Allison McCann reported today."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"The increase in poverty reversed two years of large declines. Median income, adjusted for inflation, fell 2.3 percent to $74,580. Poverty increased sharply last year in the United States, particularly among children, as living costs rose and federal programs that provided aid to families during the pandemic were allowed to expire."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"Do we own our bodies? The answer, according to many legal experts, is no. Do we own our bodies? To an ordinary person, the answer is obviously yes. To a lawyer, it’s not at all clear. That discrepancy needs to be resolved."
Alaska,2023,Q3,"President Biden went to Asia with a diplomatic to-do list. But he also wanted to show he remains up to the rigors of globe-trotting statesmanship. On the 13th hour of the third day of a two-country trip, President Biden stepped onstage at a news conference in Vietnam and bid reporters there a good evening."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"Observations from researchers and residents, published annually in a report by NOAA, reveal a region grappling with rapid change. This summer was the Arctic’s warmest on record, as it was at lower latitudes. But above the Arctic Circle, temperatures are rising four times as fast as they are elsewhere."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"Gun suicides increased from prepandemic rates in all racial and ethnic groups, but the degree of change differed drastically.

Alaska,2023,Q4,Health officials have revised their recommendations on which children should receive the new drug. Pediatricians and parents are having difficulty accessing a new immunization used to prevent severe respiratory syncytial virus infections in infants.
Alaska,2023,Q4,"In the U.S., companies seek high profits in the long-term care industry. The United States spends an average of about $13,000 per person every year on health care. No other country comes close to spending so much:"
Alaska,2023,Q4,"The Alabama Republican, under pressure from his own party, agreed to drop his objections to the remaining 11 military nominees to four-star positions, allowing their swift confirmation. The Senate confirmed nearly a dozen military officers to four-star positions on Tuesday, ending Senator Tommy Tuberville’s nearly yearlong blockade of promotions for senior generals and admirals."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"There are two Americas, and they are divided by a college degree. By many measures, the U.S. economy is thriving: Unemployment stands close to the 50-year low set in April, the fraction of people age 25 to 54 in work is at a two-decade high, gross domestic product is growing rapidly, inflation is falling, and the S&P 500 is a third higher than it was before the Covid pandemic."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"Meatless menus used to be an oddity in Germany’s capital. Today, Berlin is bursting with creative vegan options, including Spanish tapas, Berliner-style doughnuts and even fast food. When Tran Mai Huy Thong was growing up as a vegetarian in West Germany, his peers couldn’t comprehend his choice to not eat meat."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage. For 35 years, Angela Jemmott and her five brothers paid premiums on a long-term care insurance policy for their 91-year-old mother. But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"The president’s strategic options for 2024. With President Biden having fallen behind Donald Trump in the early 2024 polls, Trump’s strategy seems fairly straightforward: more of the same. Trump will portray Biden as old, inflation as high, immigration as out of control and the nation as weak. All these arguments play into the concerns of many voters."
Alaska,2023,Q4,"President Biden campaigned on stopping construction of the border wall, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and ending the death penalty. As President Biden campaigns for re-election, Democrats have heralded a series of accomplishments under his tenure. At times, Mr. Biden has called attention to promises by his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, that fell short."
Alaska,2024,Q1,"$71 million of the clothing company’s earnings have been used since September 2022 to fund wildlife restoration, dam removal and Democratic groups. A little more than $3 million to block a proposed mine in Alaska. Another $3 million to conserve land in Chile and Argentina. And $1 million to help elect Democrats around the country, including $200,000 to a super PAC this month."
Alaska,2024,Q1,"Tessa Hulls’s “Feeding Ghosts” chronicles how China’s history shaped her family. But first, she had to tackle some basics. When Tessa Hulls set out to write a book about three generations of women in her family, she had few illusions about how hard the task would be."
Alaska,2024,Q1,"The latest in a string of ambitious climate regulations aims to clean up the heaviest polluters on the road. But truckers are worried. The Biden administration on Friday announced a regulation designed to turbocharge sales of electric or other zero-emission heavy vehicles, from school buses to cement mixers, as part of its multifront attack on global warming."
Alaska,2024,Q1,"Also, the longtime N.R.A. leader, Wayne LaPierre, resigned. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. The F.D.A. announced today that it would allow Florida to import millions of dollars’ worth of prescription medications from Canada, where they are available at far lower prices than in the U.S."
Alaska,2024,Q1,"Artificial intelligence was the unofficial theme at the annual gathering of world leaders. Panel discussions, back-to-back private meetings, negotiations to get into the best parties: The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was back to its prepandemic form this year, as leaders convened to discuss the state of the world."
Alaska,2024,Q1,Most people of Middle Eastern and North African descent are classified as “white” in U.S. census data. Thousands of respondents to a Times survey told us how they actually identify.

Alaska,2024,Q1,Doctors in a handful of blue states are using shield laws to provide abortions to women in red states. Doctors in a handful of blue states have found a way to provide abortions to women in red states where it is banned or restricted. They are doing it with a new tool: laws that protect them from prosecutors elsewhere.
Alaska,2024,Q1,"Also, a Russian military plane crashed near Ukraine. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. Donald Trump’s comfortable victory last night in New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary demonstrated his ironclad control of the party’s right-wing base and set him on what could very well be a short march to his third nomination."
Alaska,2024,Q1,"Also, the Biden special counsel was attacked on Capitol Hill. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. The Biden administration announced today that it was sending more weapons to Ukraine, the first American aid package since the previous funding ran out in December. The delivery will include artillery rounds, armor systems and air defense interceptors, which are seen as critical for Ukraine’s defenses against Russian bombardment."
Alaska,2024,Q1,"The comedian gave his Jewish neurotic persona a nervy cool even as he threw his whole body into his comedy. In the 1980s, Jewish characters were scarce on television. There were broadcasters (Howard Cosell) and the occasional talk show host (Joan Rivers), but no Jews leading a cast on prime time. Then in the final year of the decade, that changed, and a glut of anxious men arrived, kvetching, quipping and dating shiksas."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"Also, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors overstepped in Jan. 6 case. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. The Democratic Party is facing a growing crisis after President Biden’s struggles in his debate against Donald Trump last night. A wide range of lawmakers, advisers and activists mulled a shocking scenario: replacing him on the ticket roughly four months before Election Day."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"How Donald Trump has slowed the cases against him. It now seems likely that Donald Trump will be able to run for president this year without having faced any legal penalties for his effort to overturn the last presidential election. To many of his supporters, of course, this outcome is just. But it is also striking."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"The former two-term Republican governor, who vetoed legislation in Maryland to expand abortion access, called himself “pro-choice” in an interview and said he would back a federal law to ensure access to the procedure. Larry Hogan, the former two-term Republican governor of Maryland who this week won his party’s nomination for the state’s open Senate seat, said in an interview on Thursday that he supports legislation to codify abortion rights in federal law, describing himself as “pro-choice” in a remarkable pivot as he heads into a highly competitive race."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"Also, the Israeli military struck Iran. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. The House took a critical step today toward approving a long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies. A majority of Democratic and Republicans lawmakers voted to advance the bills past a procedural hurdle, setting up the legislation to pass the House tomorrow."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"Asbestos, “forever” chemicals, E.V.s and endangered species. Here’s what 10 new rules cover, and why the administration has been churning them out. The Biden administration has been racing this spring to finalize a slew of major environmental regulations, including rules to combat climate change, a first-ever ban on asbestos and new limits on toxic chemicals in tap water."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"The failed test vote was the latest move by Democrats to highlight reproductive issues in the run-up to the elections in November. Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked legislation that would codify the right to access fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization, in the latest election-year bid by Democrats to spotlight G.O.P. opposition to protecting reproductive freedoms."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"Most strategies in the U.S. for helping people stay cool are geared toward urban areas, leaving behind vulnerable rural populations. In Caribou, Maine, a town of 7,400, the splash pad was packed with children at noon on Wednesday as temperatures soared. But next to it, at a cooling center for the rural area’s many elderly residents, all the folding chairs were empty, even though three air-conditioners were blasting a frigid breeze."
Alaska,2024,Q2,"In sickness and health, in public scandal and with convenient finger-pointing. By now, you’ve surely seen the latest round of high-end wife blaming in Washington.

Alaska,2024,Q3,"The American obsession with individually defining, tracking and boosting happiness may be making us miserable. Three times a day my phone pings with a notification telling me that I have a new happiness survey to take. The survey, from TrackYourHappiness.org, asks me a series of questions about what I was doing the moment right before I take it, whether I wanted to be doing it, how focused I was on my task, how productive I was being and how happy I felt about it all. I measure my emotional levels with a little toggle that slides from “bad” to “good.” Though the trackers’ authors offer a disclaimer that “correlation does not prove causation,” results from thousands of its users published in 2010 suggest that people are happier when they are focused."

Alaska,2024,Q3,"Critics say even researching the idea is dangerous. From his glass-walled, 57th-floor apartment overlooking Chicago, David Keith can see the whole of the sky. When I visited him there on a clear day this summer, the pale blue stretched from the surface of Lake Michigan up toward the edge of space."
Alaska,2024,Q3,"Also, Biden approved a secret new nuclear strategy. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. This evening, Barack Obama will headline the second night of the Democratic convention in Chicago, the city where his political career began.

Alaska,2024,Q3,"With Patriot Party News, Michael Chesebro found a sense of community, and a place where conspiracy theories could become real in the form of the “medbed.” Michael Chesebro awoke to the same reality as he did each morning, with pain radiating up his spine and into his shoulders before he opened his eyes. He remained still for a moment, summoning the courage to reach from his bed to his night stand. He rolled onto his back, which was fused together with metal after almost 20 years as a paratrooper in the military. He extended his arm, which he had broken several times while wrangling bulls and horses on his ranch outside Cheyenne, Wyo. Finally, his hand found his cellphone, and he logged on to the online universe where he spent most of his days."
Alaska,2024,Q3,"Also, Israeli forces rescued a hostage from Gaza. Here’s the latest from the end of Tuesday.

A Supreme Court prospect bowed out after it was revealed that he had smoked pot in his youth. Two candidates for attorney general were done in when it came to light that they had employed undocumented immigrants as nannies. A third cabinet nominee — a former Senate leader no less — was nixed for not paying taxes on a car and driver lent to him by an associate. Even mean tweets were enough to sink one nominee."

Alaska,2024,Q4,"Trump’s cabinet picks are the latest instance of normalizing political abhorrence. It’s been a little more than three decades since Daniel Patrick Moynihan published his famous essay on “Defining Deviancy Down.” Every society, the senator-scholar from New York argued, could afford to penalize only a certain amount of behavior it deemed “deviant.” As the stock of such behavior increased — whether in the form of out-of-wedlock births, or mentally ill people living outdoors, or violence in urban streets — society would most easily adapt not by cracking down, but instead by normalizing what used to be considered unacceptable, immoral or outrageous."

Arizona,2021,Q4,"The Cleveland Browns visit the Green Bay Packers, and the Arizona Cardinals host the Indianapolis Colts. It’s not a misprint."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"There’s a difference between being a maverick and being a narcissist. In 2003, Joe Lieberman, at the time one of the worst Democratic senators, traveled to Arizona to campaign for his party’s presidential nomination and was regularly greeted by antiwar demonstrators. “He’s a shame to Democrats,” said the organizer of a protest outside a Tucson hotel, a left-wing social worker named Kyrsten Sinema. “I don’t even know why he’s running. He seems to want to get Republicans voting for him — what kind of strategy is that?”"
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Public health in crisis At the beginning of the summer, when it looked like the U.S. was turning the corner on the pandemic, my colleagues Danielle Ivory and Mike Baker set out to answer a question: How prepared are local and state health departments for the next pandemic?"
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Cases are shooting up, I.C.U.s are stretched thin and booster vaccinations are lagging. Signs point to an intense winter wave in the United States. Cases are shooting up, I.C.U.s are stretched thin and booster vaccinations are lagging. Signs point to an intense winter wave in the United States."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Most of the results of rapid tests are not reported. That’s magnifying questions about how best to measure the spread of the virus. Millions of rapid at-home Covid tests are flying off pharmacy shelves across the country, giving Americans an instant, if sometimes imperfect, read on whether they are infected with the coronavirus."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Experts and tribal leaders aren’t sure why, but living near communities with low vaccination rates may be contributing. The Navajo Nation managed to tame Covid-19 earlier this year, mounting a campaign that drove its vaccination rate far above the United States average, after the virus ravaged the Navajo people."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"The party’s struggles in communities that saw declines in manufacturing and union jobs, and health care, could more than offset its gains in metropolitan areas. WASHINGTON — The share of the Democratic presidential vote in the Midwest declined most precipitously between 2012 and 2020 in counties that experienced the steepest losses in manufacturing and union jobs and saw declines in health care, according to a new report to be released this month."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit was filed a day after the announcement of a Jan. 4 deadline for the companies to begin their mandates or start weekly testing. The attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday in an effort to prevent the Biden administration from requiring large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations, the latest sign of growing pushback against the federal government’s biggest effort yet to enlist private businesses in combating the virus."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"Public health experts fear that the highly contagious variant cannot be stopped without harsh measures that the public will no longer tolerate. Even as President Biden on Tuesday outlined new plans for battling the highly contagious Omicron variant, public health experts warned that the measures would not be sufficient to prevent a grim rise in infections and hospitalizations over the next few weeks."
Arizona,2021,Q4,"The U.S. is one of six countries with no national paid leave. The Democrats have cut their plan to four weeks, which would still make it an outlier. Congress is now considering four weeks of paid family and medical leave, down from the 12 weeks that were initially proposed in the Democrats’ spending plan. If the plan becomes law, the United States will no longer be one of six countries in the world — and the only rich country — without any form of national paid leave."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"Two performances, so far, are being rescheduled, his tour said, after an outbreak “within the team.” The singer Justin Bieber has tested positive for the coronavirus, one day after he began his world tour in San Diego on Friday, a representative for Mr. Bieber confirmed on Sunday."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"The study found that districts with full mask requirements had 23 percent lower rates of the coronavirus among students and staff members than districts without the mandates. More and more American school districts have dropped mask mandates in recent weeks as coronavirus cases plunged across the United States. But they remain a subject of debate among some students and their parents, and a study released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that those mandates had helped protect children and teachers from the coronavirus last fall."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"People who worked out in even moderately polluted air did not show the kinds of brain improvements tied to a lower risk of dementia. Work out in polluted air and you may miss out on some of the brain benefits of exercise, according to two, large-scale new studies of exercise, air quality and brain health. The studies, which involved tens of thousands of British men and women, found that, most of the time, people who ran and rode vigorously had larger brain volumes and lower risks for dementia than their less active peers. But if people exercised in areas with even moderate levels of air pollution, the expected brain improvements from exercise almost disappeared."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"Some scientists and health experts see the possibility that the first signs of a new surge could be missed, but others say metrics like hospitalizations and wastewater monitoring have become more relevant than daily reports. A growing number of U.S. states have stopped giving daily updates of the number of new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths, which, combined with the rise of at-home testing whose results are often not officially registered, is creating a more uneven real-time look at the state of the pandemic."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"The measure, approved by the Republican-controlled legislature, mirrors the Mississippi law now before the Supreme Court. The Republican-controlled legislature in Kentucky passed sweeping legislation this week that would make abortion illegal after 15 weeks of pregnancy and grant no exemptions in cases of rape or incest."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"Most everyone agrees the unbranded animals are a problem in Gila National Forest. But fear that the federal plan involves shooting them from a helicopter has led to sharp local opposition. Hundreds of feral cattle roam freely in Gila National Forest, more than three million acres of remote and sprawling land in New Mexico with mountains, hot springs and untouched federally designated wilderness areas."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"President Biden announced that his administration would double its order of Pfizer’s scarce Covid-19 antiviral drug, which has been shown to reduce hospitalizations. WASHINGTON — The United States government doubled its order for Pfizer’s Covid pills on Tuesday, a move that will modestly increase the nation’s very limited supply of the treatment in the short term amid a record-setting surge in coronavirus cases."
Arizona,2022,Q1,The powerful political action committee said the Arizona senator could find herself “standing alone” in 2024 if she refuses to change Senate rules to force through voting rights legislation. WASHINGTON — One of the largest contributors to Senator Kyrsten Sinema’s political rise announced on Tuesday that it would cut off its financial support if the senator continues to refuse to change the Senate’s filibuster rules to allow for passage of far-reaching voting rights legislation.
Arizona,2022,Q1,"Officials say demand has slowed as coronavirus cases have fallen. But some experts question the scaling back of services, especially vaccination campaigns. CHICAGO — As Americans shed masks and return to offices and restaurants, local and state officials are scaling back the most visible public health efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic."
Arizona,2022,Q1,"A new rule will allow a pitcher who bats for himself to stay in a game as the designated hitter when he is finished pitching. TEMPE, Ariz. — Shohei Ohtani’s ascent through the majors has moved from winning the American League Most Valuable Player Award in 2021 to, essentially, having a major rule changed for him in 2022."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"Many of the millions of women who live in these states would be able to seek legal abortions elsewhere, but the barriers to access may be hard for some to overcome.

Arizona,2022,Q2,"With large expanses of grass and trees, former golf courses are being reconsidered for housing, but developers face challenges, including community resistance. SAN TAN VALLEY, Ariz. — Buffeted by rising costs and declining interest from golfers, the Links at Queen Creek course closed two years ago after 26 years of operation. But with the demand for housing in Arizona soaring, Walt Brown Jr. saw a different fate for the 106-acre parcel of grass and palm trees southeast of Phoenix."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"If the Supreme Court were to end Roe v. Wade, about half of states would be expected to ban abortion quickly or limit it heavily. If the Supreme Court were to end Roe v. Wade, about half of states would be expected to ban abortion quickly or limit it heavily."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"Far-right activists are intercepting migrant children and collecting information about their families, based on a conspiracy theory that they are falling prey to sex-trafficking rings. SASABE, Ariz. — The 15 migrant children, weary and hungry, stumbled toward a gap in the rust-colored border wall that soars between Mexico and Arizona, nearing the end of their two-week trek north. Unexpectedly, a man in a cap emblazoned with a blackened American flag — traditionally, a message that “no quarter” will be given to the enemy — approached them and coaxed them to his campsite."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"Record-breaking heat will continue through the weekend from California to South Texas. Meteorologists say the soaring temperatures may cause illness. Dangerous and potentially deadly heat will settle over the southwestern United States through much of the weekend, with temperatures in some locations expected to break records and exceed 100 degrees."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"People from around the world have been lingering on the border, awaiting the end of pandemic restrictions. Their fate remains one of the Biden administration’s biggest challenges on immigration. NOGALES, Mexico — Guadalupe Garcia crossed the border into Arizona with her 11-year-old daughter early this year, saying she was fleeing the brutal beatings she was suffering at the hands of her husband in Guatemala. The Border Patrol informed her that the United States was not open for asylum, and quickly put the pair on a bus back to Mexico."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"Under the ruling, the public health measure known as Title 42 that has denied migrants entry will remain in effect. A federal judge on Friday blocked the Biden administration from lifting a pandemic-related health order whose scheduled expiration on Monday would have thrown open the doors of the United States to asylum seekers at the border for the first time in more than two years."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"A survey by election researchers argues that efforts to confuse or scare away prospective voters disproportionately target minority groups in battleground states. When it comes to elections, disinformation is not just a problem online."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"The ban, passed by Republican lawmakers and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, is scheduled to take effect on Friday. MIAMI — In a welcome but likely brief victory for supporters of abortion rights, a judge in Florida blocked a state law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy on Thursday, the latest in a flurry of activity in state courts and legislatures following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade."
Arizona,2022,Q2,"Fifteen people have now been charged in a fraud scheme that sold drugs to treat cancer, H.I.V. and psychiatric conditions. One was charged with distributing more than $230 million in adulterated H.I.V. drugs. Two Florida men were charged last week in widespread prescription fraud cases that could have left unsuspecting patients across the country without the proper medication to treat cancer, H.I.V. and psychiatric conditions, according to federal officials."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"Amid pandemic stress and racial violence, many communities of color have turned to wilderness areas for healing. For Cynthia Philips, it was the sound of bees, willows, crickets and the hum of a metallic Tibetan bowl that helped her overcome some of her anxieties."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The passage of the bill, which appeared dead just weeks ago, caps a Democratic effort to deliver on major components of President Biden’s agenda. WASHINGTON — Congress gave final approval on Friday to legislation that would reduce the cost of prescription drugs and pour billions of dollars into the effort to slow global warming, as House Democrats overcame united Republican opposition to deliver on key components of President Biden’s domestic agenda."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The bill is the latest victory for the president on overhauling the physical economy, but he has found less support for plans to help workers. WASHINGTON — President Biden signed into law a landmark tax, health and energy bill on Tuesday that takes significant steps toward fulfilling his goal to modernize the American economy and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The bill includes billions in tax credits for the production of renewable energy, drug-pricing reforms and a boost for the I.R.S. WASHINGTON — After months of painstaking negotiations, Democrats are set to push through a climate, tax and health care package that would salvage key elements of President Biden’s domestic agenda."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The vote was a major victory for President Biden and Democrats, who are battling to maintain their slim House and Senate majorities in November’s midterm congressional elections. WASHINGTON — The Senate passed legislation on Sunday that would make the most significant federal investment in history to counter climate change and lower the cost of prescription drugs, as Democrats banded together to push through major pieces of President Biden’s domestic agenda over unified Republican opposition."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"The Opinion podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro explored the future of reproductive health care in a virtual event. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, medical providers were faced with a complex patchwork of state-level abortion bans and prohibitions. In Arizona, medical workers wondered if a century-old law banning almost all abortions and punishing providers with prison time meant that they should stop the procedures. In Wisconsin, a district attorney said he would not prosecute abortion cases after an 1849 state law banning them took effect."
Arizona,2022,Q3,"New federal data outline the scale of suffering among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Carol Schumacher, 56, who was raised in the remote community of Chilchinbeto in the Navajo Nation, has lost 42 family members to Covid-19 over the last two years. The dead included two brothers aged 55 and 54, and cousins as young as 18 and 19."

Arizona,2022,Q3,"The social networking company said that Children’s Health Defense, a group led by Mr. Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist, had “repeatedly” violated its guidelines by spreading medical misinformation. Facebook and Instagram on Thursday removed the accounts of Children’s Health Defense, an organization led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that is one of the largest U.S. anti-vaccine groups, for spreading medical misinformation."

Arizona,2022,Q4,"Even as voting goes smoothly, the 2022 midterm elections have exposed the toll Donald J. Trump’s falsehoods have taken on American democracy. Voters go to the polls on Tuesday after a campaign season so filled with conspiracy theories and lies that officials worry they will undermine confidence in the election no matter how the balloting goes."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"The measure, if signed by the president, would not affect the northern region of the country along the U.S. border. Mexico’s Senate voted on Wednesday to end daylight saving time for most of the country, signaling a preference for more daylight in the mornings and potentially ending a biannual turning of the clocks."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"While many physicians may avoid discussing the subject, a study showed that who gets addressed with the honorific “Dr.” may depend on gender, degree and specialty. Dr. Yul Yang, a dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., addresses all of his patients with an honorific — Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. — even if they ask him to use their first names. It is a sign of respect and a way of distinguishing his professional role as a doctor from a more personal role as a friend or confidant. But many patients do not reciprocate, calling him Yul instead of Dr. Yang."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Could the disease be back? The doctor’s voice over the phone was warm and reassuring. The patient, a 62-year-old man, had a chest CT earlier that day, and Dr. David Smith, his longtime P.C.P., was telling him that the radiologist saw a mass. It sounded bad, but it probably wasn’t cancer, Smith told him. “I didn’t want you to see the report and worry,” he added. The report said that the mass in his lungs looked like a neoplasm — the fancy word for tumor. But it went on to acknowledge that it could also just be left over from the really bad pneumonia the man had three months earlier."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"All of my years as an organizer have taught me to channel that anger into action, and that in itself is a discipline of hope. Imagine what it’s like to live in a state of perpetual uncertainty — at any moment you could lose your job because you no longer have the right to work legally. Picture families ripped apart — a mother sent back to a country she barely remembers, forced to leave her child behind. What would you do if the teachers, doctors and nurses in your community were suddenly barred from entering your children’s classrooms or treating your loved ones?"
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Cook County, Ill., and Toledo, Ohio, are turning to the American Rescue Plan to wipe out residents’ medical debt. Experts caution it is a short-term solution. In the next few weeks, tens of thousands of people in Cook County, Ill., will open their mailboxes to find a letter from the county government explaining that their medical debt has been paid off."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Policies in some states are also hurting efforts to keep children safe. Twenty-three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States. Last month, the C.D.C. joined with the World Health Organization to warn that the disease, which vaccines can prevent, had become “an imminent threat in every region in the world.”"
Arizona,2022,Q4,"A precariously narrow but consequential slice of the electorate broke with its own voting history to reject openly extremist Republican candidates — at least partly out of concern for the health of the political system. Not long ago, Joe Mohler would have seemed an unlikely person to help bury the political legacy of Donald J. Trump."
Arizona,2022,Q4,"Americans over 65 remain the demographic most likely to have received the original series of vaccinations. But fewer are getting the follow-up shots, surveys indicate. Linda Brantman, a retired membership salesperson at a health club in Chicago, was paying attention last month when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the new bivalent booster that protects against two variants of Covid-19. She went online and reserved an appointment at a Walgreens near her home."

Arizona,2023,Q1,"The Democratic senator from Pennsylvania is the latest public figure to disclose his mental health struggles, an indication of growing acceptance, though some stigma remains. Lynn Rivers, a Democrat from Michigan, opened up about her diagnosis with bipolar disorder during a radio call-in show when she first ran for Congress. Her opponents had been hinting she had mental health problems. She decided, spur of the moment, to let it out."
Arizona,2023,Q1,"The defeated Republican presidential candidate sued Mr. Boroson and the magazine he worked for, saying it had libeled him for suggesting that he was mentally unfit for the presidency. Warren Boroson, a journalist who conducted a survey of psychiatrists that declared the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, Barry M. Goldwater, mentally unfit to be president — provoking a libel suit from the candidate and prompting a psychiatric association to muzzle its members from ever diagnosing a public figure from afar — died on March 12 at his home in Woodstock, N.Y. He was 88."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Business groups are critical of the candidate, Julie Su, and key senators are wavering. The administration’s labor policies are central to the clash. Just over a year ago, the White House suffered an embarrassing defeat when three Democratic senators voted against advancing President Biden’s pick to run a key labor agency, dealing a blow to the administration’s pro-labor agenda."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Some are taking sick days. Others are cutting back their hours. Still others end up quitting altogether. Menopause costs American women an estimated $1.8 billion in lost working time per year, according to a Mayo Clinic study published this week. The paper examined how hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and the myriad other symptoms associated with this time of life affect women in the workplace. It’s the largest study of its kind to have been done in the United States."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Temperatures will be up to 20 degrees above normal for much of the region through at least the weekend, with no nighttime relief. Even for Southerners used to spending a lot of time outside, this week’s brutal heat and humidity — which spread from Texas across the Gulf Coast and north into Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas on Wednesday — are a little much."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"New York Times photographers are documenting the experience on both sides of the border, from Tijuana on the West Coast to Matamoros near the Gulf of Mexico. Despite concerns that the end of a public health measure known as Title 42 would bring chaos to the southern U.S. border, there were few signs of disorder on Friday in the hours after the measure expired. Yet many migrants have crossed to apply for asylum, and thousands are still being detained in Border Patrol holding facilities, awaiting processing. "
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Zoo officials suspect that a marking dye caused the deaths, but they said it could take weeks for test results to confirm. The sudden deaths of five meerkats at the Philadelphia Zoo this month have stunned zookeepers and officials, and a dye used to mark the animals might be to blame."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Also, we’re covering Russia’s increased attacks on Kyiv. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. After the House passed legislation to suspend the debt ceiling and limit federal spending last night, the bill moved to the Senate for approval. Leaders of both parties in the chamber are now fending off efforts to derail its passage and deliver the bill for President Biden’s signature before a default on U.S. debt, which is set to take place on Monday."

Arizona,2023,Q2,"A requirement that states keep people on Medicaid during the coronavirus pandemic has come to an end, and 15 million people could lose their coverage as a result. KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In a closet-sized windowless office, Kialah Marshall maintains an Excel spreadsheet with a prosaic title, “Medicaid Unwinding,” the source material for a mind-numbing routine."
Arizona,2023,Q2,"Federal law has put thousands of women on anti-addiction medications into an impossible bind: Give up your treatment or risk losing your baby. One morning in the summer of 2020, Jade Dass woke up and vomited. She assumed she was hung over; she’d been depressed lately and sometimes self-medicated with too much wine. But then a woman in her online counseling group suggested that she might be pregnant. Dass looked in the mirror and realized she was probably right."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"Amid an uptick in Covid infections, administrators, staff and patients are divided over the need for masks in health care settings. Liv Grace came down with respiratory infections three times over the course of four months. Each occurred after a visit to a medical provider in the Bay Area."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"Ballot initiatives appear to be one of the few ways for advocates to expand abortion access in conservative states. Once again, abortion access has won a victory at the polls."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"As Orlando, Fla., experiences what could be the hottest July on record, soaring rents and an affordable housing crisis are pushing a growing number of people onto the streets. Each morning, Rickquita Monroe, 34, and Curby Monroe, 32, wake up beneath an overpass in downtown Orlando, Fla. Several other people are usually spread out beside them on the sidewalks lining either side of the five-lane road. Throughout the night, they count on gusts of wind from passing traffic for relief from the thick, increasingly blistering Florida heat. It is especially dangerous to Ms. Monroe, who has a seizure disorder that is exacerbated by high temperatures."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"Hospitalizations are still low but have been rising in recent weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A late-summer wave of coronavirus infections has touched schools, workplaces and local government, as experts warn the public to brace for even more Covid-19 spread this fall and winter."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"Dangerous temperatures continue in Texas and the Southeast, with daily record temperatures possible from Florida to California. The forecast for the start of August feels very similar to the one for the start of July, with most of the Southeast, the Southern Plains and once again the Southwest facing temperatures or heat indexes in the triple digits."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate some drug prices, a change that the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have opposed for decades. As he heads toward a re-election campaign next year, President Biden is betting that his success in pushing for policies intended to lower health care costs for millions of Americans will be rewarded by voters at the ballot box."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"But we are still in the dark about 2024. One of the most significant developments in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election has emerged largely under the radar. From 2016 to 2022, the number of white people without college degrees — the core of Donald Trump’s support — has fallen by 2.1 million."
Arizona,2023,Q3,"A two-week stretch of 110-degree days sends the fire department scrambling to rescue people overcome by heat, and tests a force already accustomed to tough summers. Deirdre’s temperature was 104 degrees when the paramedics arrived on Saturday afternoon and started infusing ice-cold saline into her veins, racing to cool her before she became another victim of Phoenix’s merciless heat wave."

Clinging to a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning on Tuesday, Alex Cobb of the San Francisco Giants fired his 125th pitch of the night — an 89-mile-an-hour splitter — and Cincinnati’s Spencer Steer lined it to center field to double in a run."
Arizona,2023,Q4,"The attack in an Arizona prison was the latest violent episode involving a high-profile inmate at a federal correctional facility. Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murdering George Floyd during a 2020 arrest, was stabbed at a federal prison in Arizona in late November, according to the office of Keith Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general."
Arizona,2023,Q4,"Six months ago, Joe Faillace wasn’t sure his business could survive. He believes Phoenix’s clearing of a nearby homeless encampment saved his shop. Joe Faillace looked out the front windows of his sandwich shop this month and barely recognized the neighborhood where he has worked for almost 40 years. There were no tents within view, no emergency sirens, no campfires, no drug users slumped over on his patio or the sidewalk. Instead, he saw customers walking down quiet, clean streets toward his restaurant in time for a lunch rush that now doubles his average daily sales from early in the year."

Arizona,2023,Q4,"Hundreds of migrants have ended up needing extensive treatment in U.S. hospitals after trying to scale barriers along the southern border. Ambulances rush them daily to hospitals in El Paso, San Diego and Tucson, Ariz., writhing in pain — bones poking out of arms and legs; skulls cracked; spines shattered. The men and women arrive on stretchers flanked by an agent in the telltale green uniform of the U.S. Border Patrol."
Arizona,2023,Q4,"Congenital syphilis has become more than ten times as common over the past decade, the C.D.C. reported. “The situation is dire,” said one expert. The rise in sexually transmitted infections in the United States has taken a particularly tragic turn: More than 3,700 cases of congenital syphilis were reported in 2022, roughly 11 times the number recorded a decade ago, according to data released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Arizona,2023,Q4,"The city was under a court order to dismantle “the Zone,” a sprawling downtown homeless encampment, by Saturday. The tents and campfires were gone. The sidewalks where people had built makeshift shelters from wood pallets and blue tarps were empty. On Friday, all that was left of “the Zone,” a sprawling homeless camp in downtown Phoenix, were discarded clothes, trash and questions about what comes next."
Arizona,2023,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year.

Arkansas,2020,Q1,"The life of an Olympic athlete can be challenging and austere, and the training schedule can be relentless. Most athletes wanted a postponement, though even that has its challenges.

She loved drama and glee club, but when it came to football, she said, “I told the coach, ‘Well, I’ll tackle, but I don’t want to hurt them.’ ”"
Arkansas,2021,Q2,"Republican lawmakers in more than 30 states have introduced dozens of measures this year, the highest number of anti-transgender bills ever filed in a single year. Lawmakers in Alabama and North Dakota on Thursday approved bans on transgender girls and women competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, joining a series of Republican-led states that have focused on a rapidly growing culture clash over restricting transgender athletes and prohibiting gender-affirming medical treatments this legislative session."
Arkansas,2021,Q2,"A White House adviser said governors could consult with the Food and Drug Administration on storage procedures as the agency examines how to possibly extend the shelf life of the vaccine. State health officials are growing increasingly concerned about whether doses of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine may expire this month, warning they could go to waste if they go unused in the coming weeks or are not sent elsewhere."
Arkansas,2021,Q2,"When it comes to getting a coronavirus vaccine, Mississippi residents have an abundance of options.

Arkansas,2021,Q3,"As students prepare for a return to in-person learning, conflicts have arisen in several U.S. states over mask mandates in schools. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is looming large over this year’s back-to-school preparations in the United States."
Arkansas,2021,Q3,"A survey of data from 10 states shows that about one million doses have been lost because of spoilage, missed appointments and other problems.

Arkansas,2021,Q3,"The compounds can form PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals,” which have been linked to cancer and birth defects. The E.P.A. approvals came despite the agency’s own concerns about toxicity. For much of the past decade, oil companies engaged in drilling and fracking have been allowed to pump into the ground chemicals that, over time, can break down into toxic substances known as PFAS — a class of long-lasting compounds known to pose a threat to people and wildlife — according to internal documents from the Environmental Protection Agency."
Arkansas,2021,Q3,"Covid-19 hospitalizations are trending upward in 45 states. While levels remain well below previous peaks, health care centers in parts of the Midwest, West and South are strained. Covid-19 hospitalizations are trending upward in 45 states. While levels remain well below previous peaks, health care centers in parts of the Midwest, West and South are strained."
Arkansas,2021,Q3,"Research suggests that most vaccines still provide good protection against it and remain highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths. New cases and deaths, as well as hospitalizations, are significantly down across the country from the devastating peaks during previous national surges. The highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is now the dominant variant in the United States, accounting for 51.7 percent of infections, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Arkansas,2021,Q3,"With only about half of Americans vaccinated, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other current and former health officials vigorously pressed the case on Sunday that inoculations were the best way to stem a tide of new Covid cases. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, warned on Sunday that the coronavirus pandemic is now “going in the wrong direction” in the United States because too many Americans are still choosing not to get vaccinated."
Arkansas,2021,Q3,"Public health officials in the county had already been urging residents to wear masks indoors. The mandate will begin Saturday night, just before midnight. Los Angeles County announced Thursday that it will require masks to be worn inside regardless of vaccination status, as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads throughout California."
Arkansas,2021,Q3,"Cases, hospitalizations and deaths remain far below last winter’s peak, but the director urged people to get fully vaccinated. As the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus fuels outbreaks in the United States, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Friday that “this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”"
Arkansas,2021,Q4,"The decision continued the administration’s rollback of the Trump-era policy, targeting the only remaining state with federal approval for the requirements. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Thursday rejected work requirements for Medicaid recipients in Georgia, the last state to have a federal waiver for such restrictions, as it extended its rollback of a signature health policy of the Trump administration."

Arkansas,2021,Q4,"The lawsuit was filed a day after the announcement of a Jan. 4 deadline for the companies to begin their mandates or start weekly testing. The attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday in an effort to prevent the Biden administration from requiring large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations, the latest sign of growing pushback against the federal government’s biggest effort yet to enlist private businesses in combating the virus."
Arkansas,2021,Q4,"The shot could bring relief to parents anxious about their children getting sick, though some experts worry that those most at risk may slip through the cracks. WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in children 5 to 11, a move eagerly anticipated by millions of families looking to protect some of the only remaining Americans left out of the vaccination campaign."
Arkansas,2021,Q4,"To some who are steadfastly opposed to the shot, the evasiveness of the coronavirus has only reaffirmed their stance. CLEVELAND — As a fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus swarms across the country, hospitals in Ohio running low on beds and staff recently took out a full-page newspaper advertisement pleading with unvaccinated Americans to finally get the shot. It read, simply: “Help.”"
Arkansas,2021,Q4,"The agency may act this week, when it is expected to authorize booster shots for recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration is planning to allow Americans to receive a different Covid-19 vaccine as a booster from the one they initially received, a move that could reduce the appeal of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and provide flexibility to doctors and other vaccinators."
Arkansas,2021,Q4,"Hoping to prevent further disruptions to daily life, the C.D.C. reduced the period that certain infected Americans must sequester. As daily coronavirus cases in the United States soared to near record levels, federal health officials on Monday shortened by half the recommended isolation period for many infected Americans, hoping to minimize rising disruptions to the economy and everyday life."
Arkansas,2021,Q4,"If the C.D.C. agrees, adults who received a second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine at least six months ago could be eligible by this weekend. WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized booster shots of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for everyone 18 and older, opening up eligibility to tens of millions more fully vaccinated adults."
Arkansas,2021,Q4,"Thousands of problems identified by state inspectors were never publicly disclosed because of a secretive appeals process, a New York Times investigation found. In Arizona, a nursing home resident was sexually assaulted in the dining room."

Arkansas,2022,Q1,"While it’s unclear whether the order could be enforced, medical providers and child welfare advocates condemned the move as dangerous. Gov. Greg Abbott told state health agencies in Texas on Tuesday that medical treatments provided to transgender adolescents, widely considered to be the standard of care in medicine, should be classified as “child abuse” under existing state law."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"White-tailed deer on Staten Island have become the first wild animals with documented Omicron infections. The coronavirus has now been found in deer in 15 states. White-tailed deer on Staten Island have been found carrying the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus, marking the first time the variant has been reported in wild animals."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"The Biden administration said federal masking guidance would not change for now, but was seeking advice from public health experts on the way forward. WASHINGTON — The White House has been meeting with outside health experts to plan a pandemic exit strategy and a transition to a “new normal,” but the behind-the-scenes effort is crashing into a very public reality: A string of blue-state governors have gotten ahead of President Biden by suddenly abandoning their mask mandates."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"The overall pattern is familiar, but a fresh perspective on how to interpret cases, hospitalizations and deaths is necessary as Omicron tears through the country. The overall pattern is familiar, but a fresh perspective on how to interpret cases, hospitalizations and deaths is necessary as Omicron tears through the country."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"Reports of infections are falling in Cleveland, Newark and Washington, suggesting that a national peak may be approaching. At another bleak moment of the pandemic in the United States — with nearly 800,000 new cases a day, deaths rising and federal medical teams deploying to overwhelmed hospitals — glints of progress have finally started to emerge. In a handful of places that were among the first to see a surge of the Omicron variant last month, reports of new coronavirus infections have started to level off or decline."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"The physical toll on Mayfield, Ky., is evident. The psychological anguish will be equally difficult to overcome. MAYFIELD, Ky. — Isaiah Holt passes his days sequestered in a home that was not touched by the tornado. Still, he cannot escape the storm."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"President Biden has made “harm reduction” a central pillar of his plan to fight a record number of drug-related deaths, but a conservative backlash is threatening the effort. WASHINGTON — President Biden came into office vowing to make “harm reduction” — a public health approach geared toward helping drug users stay safe rather than abstain — a central pillar of his drug policy agenda, at a time when illicit fentanyl has driven a surge in overdose deaths."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"Muscles develop a lasting molecular “memory” of past resistance exercises that helps them bounce back from long periods of inactivity. After two years of Covid-19 and its disruptions to our exercise routines, many of us may feel like we have forgotten how to be fit. But an encouraging new study suggests that our muscles remember. The study involved mice, but it builds on similar experiments with weight training and people. It found that muscles developed a pervasive and lasting molecular “memory” of past resistance exercises that helped them bounce back quickly from long layoffs."
Arkansas,2022,Q1,"Starting in the 1960s, three physicians in Rochester, N.Y., began secretly using their own sperm to help women become pregnant. Like millions of Americans, David Berry was curious about his genealogy. He wanted to learn more about his paternal grandfather, whose ancestry was British. But as he explored his father’s side of the family, he discovered something wholly unexpected: The man he thought was his father was not related to him at all."

Many of the millions of women who live in these states would be able to seek legal abortions elsewhere, but the barriers to access may be hard for some to overcome."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Around the country, a patchwork of laws was taking hold amid protest and celebration. A new and rapidly shifting reality took hold across America on Saturday as abortion, a basic legal right for nearly a half century, was outlawed in some states, and the initial bursts of elation and shock from the overturning of Roe v. Wade gave way to action."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Five articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of narrated articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Legislators also approved a measure restricting discussion of L.G.B.T.Q. issues in public schools. Alabama lawmakers voted on Thursday to criminalize medical care for transgender young people who are transitioning, adopting some of the nation’s most restrictive language and threatening doctors and nurses with up to 10 years in prison."

Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Doctors who provide gender-affirming care are split on how to evaluate teens. This summer, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, an international group of health care professionals, plans to release an update to its guidelines for giving care. The guidelines include a chapter on adolescents that is already generating heat from across the political spectrum."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"The F.D.A. criticized measures at a hydroponics greenhouse linked to an outbreak last summer, and offered guidelines that have ramifications for the popular industry. Countless salad lovers have embraced hydroponic produce, confident that baby lettuce, arugula and herbs raised indoors in greenhouses are safer than greens rooted outdoors in farm soil."
Arkansas,2022,Q2,"Some women are stockpiling birth control, emergency contraception and abortion pills in case legislation prevents them from accessing it in their home state. Less than 48 hours after the Supreme Court said states could ban abortion, health care providers have noticed an increase in interest in birth control, emergency contraception and abortion pills."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The tentative deal would close an investigation by nearly three dozen states into the company’s marketing and sales practices. Juul Labs, fighting for its survival in the United States, on Tuesday tentatively agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen states over marketing and sales practices that they contend set off the nation’s teenage vaping crisis."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"Pregnancy loss and reproductive rights are not at odds. The demise of Roe v. Wade is causing harms that extend well beyond abortion patients. In places where abortion is heavily restricted, women with ectopic pregnancies and those experiencing inevitable miscarriages have reported delays in care that have risked their health, life and future fertility. Some have struggled to get medications to treat miscarriage because those drugs are also used for abortion."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"After Kansans voted to preserve abortion access, Republicans who once said the economy reigns supreme are acknowledging the issue will be a centerpiece in the fall campaigns. Republican candidates, facing a stark reality check from Kansas voters, are softening their once-uncompromising stands against abortion as they move toward the general election, recognizing that strict bans are unpopular and that the issue may be a major driver in the fall campaigns."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"In the West, wildfires are stopping shows. Extreme heat has led to cancellations in the South. And changing weather patterns are hobbling performances in the Northeast. ASHLAND, Ore. — Smoke from a raging wildfire in California prompted the Oregon Shakespeare Festival to cancel a recent performance of “The Tempest” at its open-air theater. Record flooding in St. Louis forced the cancellation of an outdoor performance of “Legally Blonde.” And after heat and smoke at an outdoor Pearl Jam concert in France damaged the throat of its lead singer, Eddie Vedder, the band canceled several shows."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The party is turning against a political commitment to fairness. One of the recurring points I make in my column is that the Republican Party, from the most junior state lawmaker to senators in Washington, has turned against many of the hallmarks of a functional political system, including a commitment to fairness and following the process. There are almost always new examples of Republican politicians rejecting any result or rule that doesn’t favor their interests, and this week we have two."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has prompted Democratic governors to pitch their states as better alternatives for business. As a group of conservative states enacted severe abortion restrictions last year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois sent letters to a handful of corporate executives with close ties to Texas."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The most transmissible variant yet of the coronavirus is threatening a fresh wave of infections in the United States, even among those who have recovered from the virus fairly recently.

Arkansas,2022,Q3,"“When McKinsey Comes to Town,” by the Times reporters Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe, argues that the legendary firm has accrued an inordinate amount of influence chasing profits at the expense of moral principle. In 2002, Martin Elling, along with three colleagues at the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, published an article in the firm’s quarterly journal intended to gin up more business from the pharmaceutical industry. Elling’s article argued that drug companies were missing an opportunity by not tracking how often individual physicians were prescribing certain drugs. By aggregating such data, pharmaceutical salespeople could target their marketing pitches to the doctors most likely to become heavy prescribers, and the sales reps themselves could also be better evaluated by their companies. Soon enough, a relatively unknown drug company called Purdue Pharma came calling, retaining McKinsey in 2004 to help increase sales of its opioid pain killer OxyContin — which had already topped $1 billion annually. In the face of a worsening national opioid addiction crisis and multiple state and federal investigations, prescriptions of higher-strength OxyContin pills had begun to level off. Among other recommendations, McKinsey, led by Elling and his team, suggested “turbocharging” sales through more innovative and aggressive marketing tactics. Between 2004 and 2019, Purdue paid McKinsey $83.7 million in fees."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"He made the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees an electoral force in a time of Republican hostility to organized labor. Gerald W. McEntee, the longtime president of one of the country’s largest public employee labor unions, died on Sunday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 87."
Arkansas,2022,Q3,"The continuing quest for a conservative policy reformation, and its continuing problems. The movement known as national conservatism, which just wrapped up its latest conference in Florida, is the third major attempt to solve the Republican Party’s central 21st-century policy dilemma: How does a party that historically represented the rich and big business adapt to a world where conservatism’s constituencies are not just middle class but blue-collar, downscale and disappointed with the modern American economy?"

Arkansas,2022,Q4,President Biden’s pardons for thousands of Americans convicted of possessing marijuana don’t apply to state charges or many immigrants at risk of deportation. WASHINGTON — Valerie Schultz’s conviction for possession of a small amount of marijuana in 2010 was anything but simple.
Arkansas,2022,Q4,"Workers on visas, many of them waiting years for green cards, now face having to leave the country unless they get hired within 60 days. Since Microsoft brought him to the United States 14 years ago, Abhishikt Jain has excelled professionally, raised a family and settled into a four-bedroom house with a garage “full of unnecessary stuff,” he said."
Arkansas,2022,Q4,"Prices of digital currencies have tumbled even after the exchange FTX announced a provisional lifeline by a top rival, Binance. Devastation in the crypto market continued on Wednesday, after the giant crypto exchange Binance announced a bombshell deal to buy its embattled rival, FTX. (The deal excludes FTX’s American operations.) The entire market’s capitalization now stands at $900 billion, down from $3 trillion just one year ago, while major cryptocurrencies were down by double-digit percentages. The damage is largely contained within crypto; both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed up yesterday."
Arkansas,2022,Q4,"A nonprofit on Staten Island offers a nontraditional, “ride-or-die” sphere of protection for vulnerable youth. The headquarters for the Staten Island chapter of Bikers Against Child Abuse has eight American flags, two portraits of Christopher Columbus and a stack of laminated Virgin Mary wallet inserts.

Arkansas,2023,Q2,"Fixing the background check system can be done today, but it will take work. A litany of exasperating rituals flows from America’s regular mass shootings. One of the most frustrating is the hand-wringing that our politics is so polarized that there’s no way to move forward."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"The measure would allow parents to cancel the contracts underlying their children’s accounts on sites like TikTok, Instagram, Roblox and YouTube. Over the last year, state legislators concerned about a mental health crisis among the nation’s young people have passed a raft of children’s online safety measures. A new Utah law would require social networks to obtain a parent’s consent before giving an account to a child younger than 18 while a new California law would require many sites to turn on the highest privacy settings for minors."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"The G.O.P. has a twisted view of the safety net. Work requirements for federal assistance programs do not, well, work."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"After Justice Clarence Thomas cast doubt on the Supreme Court decision that established a right to contraception, reproductive rights advocates are pressing for new protections at the state level. One year after Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court should reconsider whether the Constitution affords Americans a right to birth control, Democrats and reproductive rights advocates are laying the groundwork for state-by-state battles over access to contraception — an issue they hope to turn against Republicans in 2024."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"A requirement that states keep people on Medicaid during the coronavirus pandemic has come to an end, and 15 million people could lose their coverage as a result. KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In a closet-sized windowless office, Kialah Marshall maintains an Excel spreadsheet with a prosaic title, “Medicaid Unwinding,” the source material for a mind-numbing routine."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"After the surgeon general warned that social media harms young people, young New Yorkers agreed. Some also said that the government — and their parents — should back off.

Arkansas,2023,Q2,"A new executive order requires every federal agency to address the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate change on minority communities.

Arkansas,2023,Q2,"The rulings extend a winning streak in court for transgender-rights advocates, who are trying to block new state laws that ban gender-transition care. Federal judges in two states intervened on Wednesday to temporarily block laws that would ban gender-transition care for minors, the latest instances where legislation targeting transgender people have been halted by the judiciary."
Arkansas,2023,Q2,"An official in Martin County, Ind., said that one person died and another was injured, but that rescuers were continuing to search for victims.

Arkansas,2023,Q3,"A Georgia judge who had temporarily blocked the ban put her ruling on hold after a federal court struck down an injunction on a similar law in Alabama. A federal judge in Georgia has allowed the state’s ban on gender transition care for minors to go back into full effect, after a federal appeals court panel allowed a similar law in Alabama to be enforced. Before the appellate ruling, the same judge, Sarah Geraghty, had granted a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked part of the Georgia ban."

Arkansas,2023,Q3,"We live in two countries now: one where basic civil and human rights are recognized and another where ideological extremists can decide how everyone else lives. NASHVILLE — Two weeks ago, while the rest of America was absorbed by the hunt for a doomed submersible, people in Tennessee discovered that their attorney general was conducting a witch hunt."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"A marriage contract that makes divorce difficult is a way for some couples to protect their partnerships. However, some experts believe that this type of union has both advantages and disadvantages. Many states in America, depending on state-specific laws, allow “no-fault” divorces, in which either partner can end their marriage for any reason. But with a covenant marriage, there are stricter guidelines for ending a marriage. Revelations concerning Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, and his own covenant marriage have brought the unconventional commitment arrangement into the spotlight."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"Ohio’s governor reminds Republicans that they’re supposed to support parents’ rights, even if their children are trans. As 2023 slouches to an ignominious end, some news came Friday that gave me an unexpected jolt of hope. I have spent much of the year watching with horror and trying to document an unrelenting legal assault on queer and trans people. Around 20 states have passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans and nonbinary people, and several have barred transgender and nonbinary people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity."

Arkansas,2023,Q4,How the G.O.P. can come up with a new approach to the politics of the issue. Electoral results since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision should tell a lot of people in the Republican Party something they absolutely do not want to hear: Even rank-and-file G.O.P. voters are not as pro-life as we might have thought when Roe v. Wade was the law of the land.
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"Children are suffering under the weight of social media. New York lawmakers believe they have a strategy to halt the damage. Over the past few years, hundreds of families and school districts around the country have sued big tech companies on the grounds that the hypnotic properties of social media popular with children have left too many of them unwell. Citing the promotion of the “corpse bride” diet, for example, and other practices around dangerous forms of weight loss, Seattle Public Schools filed a complaint in January arguing that platforms like TikTok and Snapchat have been so unsparing in their delivery of harmful material to students that the resulting anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation were interfering with the school system’s primary mission of educating children."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term. The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows."
Arkansas,2023,Q4,"Multiple lawmakers refused to honor their party’s internal selection of Steve Scalise, continuing the chaos over the speakership with no end in sight. Republicans used to consider themselves the orderly party, the one that assiduously adhered to the rules and respected the will of the majority. But the traditional rule book has been thrown out the window when it comes to the extraordinary tumult in the House."

Arkansas,2024,Q1,"A new Florida law also requires apps like TikTok and Snapchat to obtain a parent’s consent before giving accounts to 14- and 15-year-olds. Florida on Monday became the first state to effectively bar residents under the age of 14 from holding accounts on services like TikTok and Instagram, enacting a strict social media bill that is likely to upend the lives of many young people."
Arkansas,2024,Q1,"How is Americans’ love for hamburgers, chicken nuggets and cheese pizza affecting the environment — and specifically groundwater levels? These two graphs were previously published in The New York Times. The original article also includes maps that display the decline in groundwater (or aquifer) levels, in Arkansas because of growing soybeans for chicken feed, and in Idaho, because of growing alfalfa fed to cows which produce milk for cheese."
Arkansas,2024,Q1,"Its decision that embryos are people offers a warning of the future toward which America may be heading. I never thought I’d be grateful to the Alabama Supreme Court for anything, but now I am.

It has awakened the American public, finally, to the peril of the theocratic future toward which the country has been hurtling."
Arkansas,2024,Q1,"The retailer brings about 2,000 managers a year to its headquarters to discuss how to relate to workers and customers, part of a U.S. corporate trend. On a stormy afternoon in Bentonville, Ark., a Walmart regional manager recounted a story about a moment when his humanity came up short."
Arkansas,2024,Q1,"The rules give federal officials more leeway to protect species in a changing climate. Industry groups are expected to sue.

Trump."
Arkansas,2024,Q1,"Economists are trying to gauge whether forecasts of a slowing labor market were mistaken or just premature. For now, gains are consistent and strong. If the economy is slowing down, nobody told the labor market."
Arkansas,2024,Q1,"The number from officials and news reports is likely to rise as authorities assess the fallout from the extreme conditions in many parts of the country.

Arkansas,2024,Q3,Ten states have ballot measures to establish a right to abortion in their state constitutions. The pushback has already begun.

Arkansas,2024,Q3,"It’s a change from 2016, when House Republicans were the preferred candidates. At least two senators — J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio — are on the short list for the vice president slot. After Donald J.

Arkansas,2024,Q3,"In a military career that spanned three decades, Tim Walz achieved one of the highest enlisted ranks in the Army. Some peers took issue with the timing of his retirement.

Arkansas,2024,Q4,"Readers had concerns about whether same-sex married couples and their protections would face new risks during a second Trump term.

Soon, she noticed spiders crawling up the wall."
Arkansas,2024,Q4,"The point of placing loyalists in positions of influence isn’t to make the government work; it is to bend the government to Trump’s will. So far, the incoming Trump administration looks exactly as terrible as any reasonable person could have imagined during the campaign."

Arkansas,2024,Q4,"We explain why the issue of abortion didn’t necessarily help Democrats win this election. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

This is a situation in which apathy could have awesome consequences: California, which isn’t as liberal a state as you may imagine but is nonetheless considerably more liberal than the nation as a whole, may be about to absent-mindedly acquire a Trumpist governor who could never win a normal election."
California,2021,Q3,"Kevin Faulconer, a former San Diego mayor, says his collaborative approach to government will resonate with Californians weary of partisan tribalism. He was the mayor of San Diego, California’s second-largest city, for the better part of a decade until he reached his term limit last year, praised in some quarters for being an increasingly rare moderate Republican in a state where the G.O.P. has struggled."
California,2021,Q3,"The bill would rein in production quotas at warehouses that critics say are excessive and force workers to forgo bathroom breaks. Among the pandemic’s biggest economic winners is Amazon, which nearly doubled its annual profit last year to $21 billion and is on pace to far exceed that total this year."
California,2021,Q3,"Californians will soon vote on whether to recall their Democratic governor. Could he lose? California Republicans began the effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom before the pandemic upended everything. But without a doubt, the pandemic enabled the recall: The courts gave organizers more time to collect the necessary signatures, and Newsom’s handling of the pandemic, including his visit to a swanky restaurant in wine country amid his own lockdown orders, eroded his support."
California,2021,Q3,Similar mandates have gained momentum among both public and private employers as cases have jumped across the country with the spread of the Delta variant. California became the first state to issue a vaccine mandate for all educators in public and private schools on Wednesday when Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered teachers and school staff members to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or face weekly testing.
California,2021,Q3,"Counties with above-average levels of vaccination have some of the lowest Covid-19 hospitalization rates.

California,2021,Q4,"Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for a 15 percent reduction in water usage, but we’re far from that target. The results are in: Californians aren’t saving enough water."
California,2021,Q4,"The discovery in San Francisco County prompted the Biden administration to renew calls for everyone to get fully vaccinated and receive a booster, if eligible. WASHINGTON — The Omicron coronavirus variant was reported in the United States for the first time on Wednesday in a traveler who had been in South Africa, as scientists around the world study whether the variant is more transmissible or virulent than its predecessors."
California,2021,Q4,"About one in five support Roe v. Wade being overturned, a number that has remained largely unchanged for more than a decade. The hundreds of women’s marches staged across the country over the weekend had a clear rallying cry: Don’t let America go the way of Texas."
California,2021,Q4,"The most populous state is considering big changes to math instruction. Today, we’re looking at California’s proposal to change math instruction, and a plan for a new university championed by conservative thinkers."
California,2021,Q4,"Once an anti-vaccine stronghold, Marin County has become an unlikely champion of Covid-19 shots. But will it last? The pocket of California that has emerged as a leader in Covid-19 vaccinations may come as a surprise."
California,2021,Q4,"The state has become the first to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for schoolchildren. In some ways, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent decision to require Covid-19 vaccinations for all schoolchildren as early as next year is straight out of the California pandemic playbook."

California,2022,Q1,"If the state follows the trajectory of other places hit hard by the variant, cases should begin leveling off soon. Over the past week or so, new coronavirus infections have begun to fall in parts of the United States where the Omicron variant first proliferated: Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Washington, D.C."
California,2022,Q1,"Temporary units for the homeless might sound good, but where does one go from there? Nearly everyone in California has an opinion about the homelessness crisis, but very few people have a realistic vision of what to do about it. In the Bay Area and Los Angeles, where thousands of people sleep on the streets or in tent encampments every night, one of the more popular proposals has been to build many new units of temporary shelter. These take many forms: tiny-home villages that provide a shed-size house for two residents, repurposed hotel rooms and “Safe Sleep” sites where people can move into tents. The idea is to continue to scatter these various units throughout mostly low-income areas of cities, especially those that have been overtaken by unofficial homeless encampments."
California,2022,Q1,"It’s more than just the absence of months of snow and subzero temperatures. A reader who moved from New York to the Bay Area emailed me recently, “The best part of winter in California is that there is no winter.”"

California,2022,Q2,"Though fires increasingly erupt year-round in the Golden State, those in the summer and fall tend to be far more destructive. It’s almost July, which is typically the beginning of California’s fire season."

Please preview these resources to make sure they are appropriate for your students. "
California,2022,Q2,"There are thousands of apps that claim to promote mental well-being, but not all of them are safe or effective. With therapists in high demand and long waiting lists that make it challenging to find a provider, using a mental health app might seem like a tempting and relatively inexpensive way to get help."
California,2022,Q2,"Rules announced around the state are considered merely an incremental solution to a far-reaching, permanent problem. For 15 years, Jeffrey Kightlinger was the general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to about 19 million people — nearly half of all Californians — across six counties, including Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego."
California,2022,Q2,"State officials have lifted mask mandates for most places, but not everywhere. To mask or not to mask? That is the question."
California,2022,Q2,"Lounges where customers consume cannabis on site are the next frontier of the state’s recreational marijuana industry.

Wade, Gloria Allred told the crowd about an illegal abortion that almost killed her."
California,2022,Q2,"As conservative states move to enact far-right legislative agendas, California leaders say they’re spearheading the resistance. If there’s one thing we know about California’s officials, it’s that they love to declare that California is a leader in everything — whether it’s tackling climate change or transforming the world through technology."
California,2022,Q3,The measure will create a state council to establish minimum pay and regulate safety conditions on an industrywide basis.

California,2022,Q3,"Los Angeles County, San Francisco and the state as a whole have issued emergency declarations because of the growing outbreak.

California,2022,Q3,"As several cities in Northern California set records, some experts are trying to draw more attention to the effects of hot weather. On Tuesday, the heat dome punishing the West continued its suffocating stay over California, sending temperatures to all-time highs, making it harder to fight the wildfires now burning in various parts of the state and contributing to any post-holiday malaise residents may have been experiencing."
California,2022,Q3,"The closing of a meatpacking plant near downtown Los Angeles has left its workers reeling and amplified questions about doing business in the state. VERNON, Calif. — Teresa Robles begins her shift around dawn most days at a pork processing plant in an industrial corridor four miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

California,2022,Q3,"Dr. Courtney Pedersen and Eddie Bearnot, who both work to promote health in others, overcame a medical crisis of their own.

California,2022,Q3,"Should we turn strip malls and office parks into homes, even if it means hiring nonunion workers? One cause of California’s severe shortage of housing is well known: The state is plagued by byzantine zoning rules and other local restrictions on development that make it extraordinarily difficult to build new places to live. In other words, NIMBYism."
California,2022,Q3,The state is shoring up resources to be the nation’s abortion refuge. .

California,2022,Q4,"Supporters of decriminalization, which takes effect Jan. 1, say the laws have disproportionately targeted people based on race and economic status.

But there was one extra thing holding him back: Nearly $5,000 in fines for jaywalking and similar offenses."

California,2022,Q4,"The state is undertaking the nation’s most ambitious effort so far to compensate for the economic legacy of slavery and racism.

California,2022,Q4,"The Regents chose not to block U.C.L.A. from leaving the Pac-12. But it attached conditions that could cost the school more than $20 million annually, including some money that would be diverted to U.C. Berkeley. LOS ANGELES — The University of California Board of Regents voted on Wednesday to approve U.C.L.A.’s move to the Big Ten Conference, but attached conditions meant to ensure that money the school reaps from its new league’s lucrative television contract would offset the byproducts of athletes making repeated trips across the country for sporting events."
California,2022,Q4,"U.C. administrators and a majority of union leaders have a deal to end the walkout, but there’s a movement afoot to convince the rank and file to reject the agreement. Last week, when the University of California and negotiators for striking academic workers announced a tentative agreement to end the work stoppage that began on Nov. 14, union representatives praised the proposed contract."
California,2023,Q1,"DeVone Boggan has an unusual yet effective way to prevent shootings: Mentor and pay young people who are seen as likely to commit gun violence otherwise.

California,2023,Q1,"Seeking to shut down the nation’s largest death row, the governor is proceeding with a mix of conviction and caution.

The pandemic and its lockdowns accelerated a mental health crisis in the United States, leaving treatment providers racing to keep up with the growing demand for care."
California,2023,Q2,"The mifepristone ruling may lead to all sorts of drugs and treatments disappearing. In their zeal to continue upending abortion access after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, legislators, activists and litigants have pushed increasingly extreme measures that disregard medical science, insert government into the exam room and increase the odds of maternal deaths. Not satisfied with banning abortion in their home states, some lawmakers are trying to restrict access in other states as well — a chilling attempt to intimidate patients and physicians alike."
California,2023,Q2,"The men, Tibet Ergul, 21, and Chance Brannon, 23, were arrested on Wednesday morning and charged with damaging the clinic last year, federal authorities said.

California,2023,Q2,"The regulation, which must be approved by the federal government, is the latest in a series of ambitious moves by the state to cut planet-warming pollution from vehicles.

California,2023,Q2,A task force recommended that legislators enact a sweeping program to compensate for the economic harm from racism in the state’s history.

California,2023,Q2,"Average life expectancy has risen by 16 years since the national retirement age was set at 65. We asked health experts when they think people should stop working now.

He set the retirement age at 70. Average life expectancy at the time? About 40 years."

California,2024,Q1,"Two of the most cautious states have bypassed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by letting students and workers who have the virus but are asymptomatic avoid isolation. From the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been doctor’s orders in this country: If you test positive, stay away from other people, even if you aren’t coughing or feverish. In recent months, however, that rule has been relaxed in two of the unlikeliest places. "

Several more cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were reported in the United States on Thursday, including five people in New York City and on Long Island, officials said. Other cases were reported in Minnesota, Hawaii, California and Colorado."
Colorado,2021,Q4,"The main reason for the discrepancies is that state and county data does not always properly link the record of people’s booster shots to their initial vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which millions of Americans rely on for up-to-date information on vaccination rates in their communities, recently acknowledged that its data might overestimate the number of people who have received first doses while underestimating the number who have received booster shots."
Colorado,2021,Q4,"The injured, all students at Aurora Central High School in Colorado, were shot at nearby Nome Park. They range in age from 14 to 18.

Colorado,2021,Q4,"Officials are seeking to avert a winter surge; last year, so many Covid patients died that officials were forced to deploy mobile morgues. California is opening up eligibility for booster coronavirus vaccine shots to include anyone 18 or over, making it at least the second state to expand official eligibility beyond older adults and people in high-risk circumstances. Colorado took a similar step this week. "

The highly mutated Omicron variant of the coronavirus had been reported in at least 16 states by Saturday, with Washington state reporting three new cases."
Colorado,2021,Q4,"He showed that while a healthy lifestyle won’t help us live much longer, it can stave off chronic disease and disability until our final years. James F. Fries majored in philosophy as an undergraduate, so it’s no surprise that as a medical researcher he was obsessed with how to lead a good life, even though his interest was more about physical than moral well-being."
Colorado,2021,Q4,"The adult hyenas, who tested positive for the coronavirus, have so far exhibited mild symptoms of Covid, but they are believed to be “in good shape and improving,” a zoo spokesman said. Two spotted hyenas at the Denver Zoo have tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in the world among hyenas, zoo and veterinary services officials announced on Friday."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"A number of the stores’ nearly 500,000 employees have reported being homeless, receiving government food stamps or relying on food banks.

Colorado,2022,Q1,"Dogs and cats have surprised their owners by gaining weight during the coronavirus pandemic. Veterinarians blame the extra treats and table scraps. It had been a year since Henry’s last haircut, and Michelle Holbrook did not realize that her 7-pound, goofy toy poodle was now almost 9 pounds. His cute, shaggy look not only obscured his weight, it also made it harder for the Holbrooks to resist his begging."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"The plan aims to inoculate Democrats in conservative-leaning states from Republican attacks on cultural issues, underscoring how successful the G.O.P. has been at weaponizing them. WASHINGTON — A cluster of House Democrats from conservative-leaning districts is circulating a reworked legislative agenda for the coming election season that would embrace some of President Biden’s most popular initiatives and tackle rising prices while distancing lawmakers from the left’s most divisive ideas."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"Studies show female patients and people of color are more likely to have their symptoms dismissed by medical providers. Experts say: Keep asking questions. Jenneh Rishe could easily run six miles in under 45 minutes — until suddenly she couldn’t. In the spring of 2019, Mrs. Rishe, now 35, began finding her daily jogs a struggle."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"Democrats were cheered for strict lockdowns and pandemic precautions. Now many weary voters want to hear the party’s plan for living with the coronavirus. When the coronavirus pandemic first swept Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf closed stores and schools and ordered millions of citizens to stay home. Even four months into the crisis in 2020, all but “life-sustaining” businesses in much of the state were locked down."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"After a scare in November, New Jersey’s governor and other Democratic leaders held back-channel talks over lifting mandates and helping voters impatient with restrictions reclaim a sense of normalcy. Gov. Kathy Hochul will drop New York’s stringent indoor mask mandate on Wednesday, ending a requirement that businesses ask customers for proof of full vaccination or require mask wearing at all times, and marking a turning point in the state’s coronavirus response, according to three people briefed on her decision."
Colorado,2022,Q1,"And if so, how can I tell if I’m overdoing it? Q: I hike seven miles per day, spend five to six hours per week in vigorous fitness exercise, and about four hours per week performing heavy resistance training. Is it possible to exercise too much? And how much is too much?"

Colorado,2022,Q2,"Democratic interference in Republican primaries paid off in some places but not others, election-denying candidates were halted in Colorado, and incumbents proved their staying power.

Out of 50 states, there are 13 that have passed so-called trigger laws that would outlaw abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. But what’s happening in states that do not have a trigger law?"

She was 81."
Colorado,2022,Q2,"In many places, there is no system for sharing home test results with health officials, but the information may still be beneficial for public health. So, you got a positive result on your home test for Covid-19. What do you do next? In addition to everything else on your plate — isolating and notifying close contacts, taking time off work and rescheduling appointments — it’s good practice to report your test results."
Colorado,2022,Q2,"Life expectancy in the United States continued to drop in 2021, while rebounding from the pandemic in many other high-income countries, according to a new preliminary analysis that found the U.S. decline was driven largely by deaths among white Americans.

Colorado,2022,Q2,"In “Under the Skin,” Linda Villarosa disproves once and for all the theory that people of color are responsible for their own failed health care. In 1973, two Black girls, 14-year-old Minnie Lee Relf and her 12-year-old sister, Mary Alice, were forcibly taken from their home in Montgomery, Ala., and sterilized at a clinic funded by the federal government. Their parents — who had been displaced from rural Alabama into a cardboard shanty in the city and could not read or write — were tricked into agreeing to the procedure. Two years earlier, doctors had already begun to inject their oldest daughter, 15-year-old Katie, with the Depo-Provera contraceptive, then unapproved even for adult women, never mind teenagers."
Colorado,2022,Q2,"The lawsuit argues that the state’s ban violates several provisions in the State Constitution, including the right to determine family composition and the right to equality between the sexes.

Colorado,2022,Q2,"Rules announced around the state are considered merely an incremental solution to a far-reaching, permanent problem.

Colorado,2022,Q3,"A meditation on skulls, in which the skulls themselves get to have an opinion. This poem is part of a sonnet sequence that meditates on Andrea Modica’s photographs of skulls unearthed from the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo. In this sonnet (there’s a dropped line in the poem, making it technically 15 lines — one more than a traditional sonnet), the speaker compares two kinds of skulls: anonymous skulls at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh and the tagged and mounted skulls in Colorado. Paisley Rekdal’s poems are often struck with intellect, and this one is no different — in the second part of the poem during the volta, or the turn in a sonnet, the skulls are animated with their own opinions. The syntax mirrors a thinking mind. Note all the interruptions, from the em-dash after “rain,” to the commas, to the colon after “witnesses,” to the line breaks, as if to say that the only way to make sense of horror is to populate it with the turning language of logic."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"Getting a mental health diagnosis can be a huge relief. But can the label become a problem? Five years ago, seemingly out of nowhere, my brain fell into an abyss of unrelenting intrusive thoughts — What if I harm myself? What if I harm others? What if I’m crazy? — each of which was accompanied by electric shocks of anxiety and full-on sensations of dread. It was, by far, the most terrifying, vexing and isolating period of my life. My first moment of relief came four weeks later, when I finally got in to see a psychiatrist."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"As states report less frequently, changes in the trajectory of the virus are slower to reveal themselves. At a glance, the pandemic picture in the United States may seem remarkably stable. The average number of new confirmed coronavirus cases per day has hardly budged for weeks, hovering between 95,000 and 115,000 a day each day in June."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"While some mass shootings are committed by people with diagnosed mental illnesses, a life crisis is a better predictor of violence, researchers say. The freshman who walked into the high school cafeteria in Marysville, Wash., in 2014 with his father’s .40-caliber Beretta did not fit anyone’s profile of a mass murderer. He was a crack athlete. He embraced his Native American traditions, wearing a headdress at tribal events and offering freshly killed deer to his grandmother. He was popular, so much so that he had just been elected homecoming prince."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"Even in some states where abortion remains legal, wait times for appointments are long because of increased demand. The reversal of Roe v. Wade did not affect the legal status of abortion in New Mexico, where seven clinics are still operating. But that does not mean an abortion is easy to obtain there."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"The state that spurred the overturning of abortion rights is among 17 that have not adopted a new option to extend new mothers’ Medicaid coverage for a year. JACKSON, Miss. — Like low-income pregnant women around the country, nearly every patient at the Sisters in Birth clinic here is covered by Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor. But they face the prospect of losing the coverage two months after their babies are born, when they are still at high risk of complications that could lead to serious illness — or even death."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"The recall by Big Olaf Creamery came as federal authorities are investigating its products, which have been linked to infections that led to one person’s death and the hospitalization of two dozen. A Florida business is recalling its ice cream amid an investigation into a listeria outbreak that has been blamed for the death of one person and the hospitalization of two dozen, the Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"In the West, wildfires are stopping shows. Extreme heat has led to cancellations in the South. And changing weather patterns are hobbling performances in the Northeast. ASHLAND, Ore. — Smoke from a raging wildfire in California prompted the Oregon Shakespeare Festival to cancel a recent performance of “The Tempest” at its open-air theater. Record flooding in St. Louis forced the cancellation of an outdoor performance of “Legally Blonde.” And after heat and smoke at an outdoor Pearl Jam concert in France damaged the throat of its lead singer, Eddie Vedder, the band canceled several shows."
Colorado,2022,Q3,"Everyone and their mother seems to be playing. What’s the draw — and is it really a workout? Now that their son is grown and their water-loving Labrador retriever has passed away, Kristen Miller and her husband, Scott Miller, have decided to fill in their San Diego swimming pool. “No one uses it, there’s a drought and we’re in our 60s,” she said. “We decided YOLO, like the kids say. We’re gonna put in a frickin’ pickleball court.”"
Colorado,2022,Q3,"It is the only one of the company’s more than 500 stores with a formal union, but similar moves are afoot elsewhere. Following a recent trend of service workers organizing at companies like Starbucks, Apple and Amazon, employees at a Trader Joe’s in Hadley, Mass., voted to unionize on Thursday. It is the only one of the company’s more than 500 stores with a formal union."
Colorado,2022,Q4,"Beyond making tough moments a little easier, cultivating levity is good for your health. Wendi Aarons was writing at her local library when the sound of an angry voice made everyone look up. A patron, outraged over a book policy, vowed to take her child to another library and stormed off after berating the staff. The entire room was “so upset,” recalled Ms. Aarons, a humorist in Austin, Texas. “It was just this awful, uncomfortable silence.”"
Colorado,2022,Q4,"Club Q, the scene of a deadly shooting in Colorado Springs on Saturday night, was to hold a brunch event on Sunday for those lost their lives to anti-transgender violence. Hours before it was hit by a deadly mass shooting Saturday night, Club Q in Colorado Springs posted on Facebook about a planned “all ages drag brunch” on Sunday morning. The event was described by the club as a celebration of the Transgender Day of Remembrance, which honors the memory of transgender people who lost their lives to anti-transgender violence."
Colorado,2022,Q4,"Policies in some states are also hurting efforts to keep children safe. Twenty-three years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States. Last month, the C.D.C. joined with the World Health Organization to warn that the disease, which vaccines can prevent, had become “an imminent threat in every region in the world.”"
Colorado,2022,Q4,"The Sheriff’s Office in Clear Creek County, Colo., said it fired the deputies, Andrew Buen and Kyle Gould, after they were charged in connection with the shooting of Christian Glass, 22, in June.

Colorado,2022,Q4,"With Republicans taking control of the House in January, the chances that Congress will consider any added restrictions in next two years are also exceedingly slim.

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Thursday against AmerisourceBergen, one of the country’s largest pharmaceutical distributors, accusing the company of knowingly distributing opioids that were later resold illegally."
Colorado,2022,Q4,"Mental health experts say that many American men are in crisis. One solution is to convince them that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. Mental health experts have long known that while women have nearly twice the rate of depression diagnoses, men are much more likely to die by suicide, drug overdose and alcohol related deaths — sometimes referred to as deaths of despair. Nearly 80 percent of suicides are among men, with males over age 75 and those who work in traditionally blue collar jobs, such as mining, construction and agriculture, having the highest rates."

Colorado,2023,Q2,"With “infinity dollars” poured in by the creators of “South Park,” a fabled Colorado restaurant reopens with the same 1970s vibe and drastically improved food. Colorado’s defining features include glorious mountain peaks, vivid seasonal colors, skiing and a widespread compulsion to exercise and eat well. But for generations of Colorado children, arguably the most commonly shared experience involved Casa Bonita, a vast, filthy, poorly-lit, underground restaurant with food that many diners deemed barely edible."

Colorado,2024,Q1,"The justice distanced herself from the majority, saying it had gone too far, and from the three liberals, saying their tone sent the wrong message.

Both had jobs at a local medical clinic: Mr. Ferguson was interning in the dental department. Ms. Prendergast was filing papers and filling out immunization cards alongside her best friend, Tara Jo Ferguson (no relation to Mr. Ferguson). Though the girls had spent previous summers playing soccer in the streets and dancing, Ms. Ferguson’s mother was a nurse, and that year she put them to work."

Connecticut,2021,Q4,"To overturn Roe now would be an act of constitutional vandalism — not conservative, but reactionary. In 1989 I argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, a case challenging a Missouri statute that forbade the use of state funds or facilities for abortions.

Instead, they’re largely standing in the way."

While the company claimed its beverage would “give you wings,” it never said it was actually good for people."
Connecticut,2023,Q3,"Modern medicine is constantly showing us our guts and bones. Why doesn’t it feel more profound? It wasn’t that I thought medical imaging was simple, precisely. I understood that a real human body is complicated — that the anatomy textbooks were the map, not the territory. I understood that the plastic dummy with its removable organs was a model, not an exact representation; that the brightly colored images hanging in the doctor’s office were not photographs; that the episode of “The Magic School Bus” in which the class travels through Arnold’s digestive system was not a documentary. Still, what I did not anticipate was that when confronted with an image of my own body — the product of the rotating series of X-rays known as a CT scan — I wouldn’t recognize it at all. I don’t mean as myself, but as anything."
Connecticut,2023,Q3,"Health officials are investigating whether the Soft Serve on the Go brand, produced by Real Kosher Ice Cream, was behind an outbreak of listeria, a bacteria that can cause serious illness. An ice cream company based in Brooklyn has issued a recall of all flavors of its soft serve ice cream and sorbet brand after two people who ate its vanilla chocolate flavor fell sick and were sent to the hospital, according to the company and health officials.

Connecticut,2023,Q3,"Ed Rodriguez is on a mission to convince his neighbors that they need trees to help combat summer heat — and to make the world a better place. It’s not always so easy. Maria Gonzalez, who lives in New Haven, Conn., was envious of the other side of her street. It was lined with trees, offering some beauty as well as a shield from this summer’s unusual heat. But the sidewalk directly in front of her residence was bare, with trash littering patches of grass."
Connecticut,2023,Q3,"Ashutosh Upreti asked Katherine Maher out for drinks after they met at a friend’s Seder. At first, she mistakenly thought their get-together was for a job and began interviewing him. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Katherine Roberts Maher and Ashutosh Upreti got down to business over drinks in April 2019 at the now-shuttered Bond Bar in San Francisco’s Mission District."
Connecticut,2023,Q4,"Emergency rooms are among the most dangerous workplaces in the United States. Crushing chest pain, an itch that festers into torment, an inconsolable baby, no place to sleep at 3 a.m., an ankle twisted on a jog, a fentanyl overdose, a car crash, the need to tell someone, “I feel sad and lonely.” The only place that tends to this kaleidoscope of needs is the emergency room, its doors perpetually open to all."

Connecticut,2023,Q4,"Mississippi has long had high childhood immunization rates, but a federal judge has ordered the state to allow parents to opt out on religious grounds. For more than 40 years, Mississippi had one of the strictest school vaccination requirements in the nation, and its high childhood immunization rates have been a source of pride. But in July, the state began excusing children from vaccination if their parents cited religious objections, after a federal judge sided with a “medical freedom” group."

Connecticut,2023,Q4,"The F.D.A. has approved many new programs that use artificial intelligence, but doctors are skeptical that the tools really improve care or are backed by solid research.

Connecticut,2024,Q1,"Many state laws take effect on the first day of 2024, including new rules on gun safety, a ban on diversity programs and a curb on telemarketing calls.

Perhaps the most significant change bans programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion at publicly funded colleges and universities in Texas."
Connecticut,2024,Q2,"Though the academic scene continues to imbue this coastal Connecticut city with a certain gravitas, surrounding neighborhoods are showing off their own cultural capital in the realms of art, food, music and more. The 75-foot-long brontosaurus at the newly reopened Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Conn., is the same dinosaur that the natural history museum has had on display since 1931. Yet it looks different. A fresh pose. New front ribs. The head is repositioned at a more inquisitive angle. The museum’s four-year renovation not only refreshed the nearly 100-year-old building, but also included an overhaul of the fossil mounts that research has proved to be inaccurate."
Connecticut,2024,Q2,"NYU Langone Health gave the nurse, Hesen Jabr, an award for her work. She said hospital officials then fired her because she made pro-Palestinian remarks in an acceptance speech.

Connecticut,2024,Q2,"Mammography can miss tumors in women with dense breasts, so their doctors often include ultrasound or M.R.I. scans. Patients often wind up paying the bill.

Shaken by the incident, Ms. Bugg knew what she needed to do next: see a therapist."

Delaware,2023,Q1,"A recent report found high concentrations of cadmium and lead in dark chocolate. There’s no reason to panic, experts say, but it’s worth a closer look. Q: There were a number of news articles about cadmium and lead in dark chocolate recently, and it made me incredibly anxious as someone who eats very dark chocolate every day — including during my pregnancy and breastfeeding!

Delaware,2023,Q2,"When coverage upsets them, towns and counties are revoking newspapers’ lucrative contracts to print public notices.

Delaware,2023,Q2,"Democrats and abortion-rights leaders said the decision could be a catastrophe and used the moment to criticize Republicans, who remained relatively quiet on Friday. As Americans digested a Texas judge’s ruling on Friday night invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone — and a contradictory ruling from a Washington State judge ordering the F.D.A. to maintain its approval as is in some states — the divide in political reactions was as much between words and silence as it was between pro- and anti-abortion rights."
Delaware,2023,Q2,A jury sided with Gilead Sciences in a dispute over whether the government could claim a share of profits from drugs seen as crucial to ending the H.I.V. epidemic.

Delaware,2023,Q2,"All fans should want their teams to be more like Osasuna. It is not quite eight years since Osasuna found itself at what Fran Canal, the team’s chief executive, described as the “worst moment in its history.” The team was a single defeat from the ignominy of relegation to Spanish soccer’s third tier. Bankruptcy loomed. The club, he said, stood at the precipice “socially, economically, in terms of credibility.”"
Delaware,2023,Q2,"The way health care providers negotiate drug prices has put the squeeze on manufacturers. The Times reported last month that drug shortages in the United States are approaching record levels, with thousands of patients facing delays in getting cancer treatments, a drug that reverses lead poisoning, a sterile fluid needed to stop the heart for bypass surgery and antibiotics for strep throat, among many other medicines. One doctor described the shortages as a national health emergency."

Delaware,2023,Q3,"The plaintiffs want the state to drop its residency requirement. Oregon and Vermont have already done so. Judy Govatos has heard that magical phrase “you’re in remission” twice, in 2015 and again in 2019. She had beaten back Stage 4 lymphoma with such aggressive chemotherapy and other treatments that at one point she grew too weak to stand, and relied on a wheelchair.

The hike was widely expected."
Delaware,2023,Q3,"In the return of this scathing satire on Peacock, the economy is a swamp full of predators and prey. It is tempting to say that “Killing It,” on Peacock, is a satire of dog-eat-dog capitalism. But that would be an understatement. There’s also plenty of human-kill-snake capitalism. And snake-eat-human. And shark-eat-human. And giant snail — well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"The Justice Department charged President Biden’s son after a long-running and wide-ranging investigation with substantial political repercussions.

Delaware,2023,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage. For 35 years, Angela Jemmott and her five brothers paid premiums on a long-term care insurance policy for their 91-year-old mother. But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"Articles from around The Times, narrated just for you. This weekend, listen to a collection of articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"The charges against the president’s son may add momentum to the investigation just as House Republicans are holding a vote to formally authorize it, but they do nothing to implicate President Biden. The scathing and salacious federal indictment against Hunter Biden on tax evasion charges has provided a boost to House Republicans at a critical time in their impeachment inquiry against President Biden, spotlighting the kind of wrongdoing by his son that they have repeatedly tried and failed to connect to the president himself."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"Despite writing a best seller that became a hit Netflix series, Ms. Land says she still worries about her job security. What do you do with the money you earn from a story you wrote about not having much for too many years?"
Delaware,2023,Q4,"In the Police Department, the rank and file is hearing rumors of buyouts and demotions, but many see the mayor’s plan to shrink the department as a political tactic. Soon after Mayor Eric Adams said he would enact a hiring freeze at the Police Department, the alarming texts began to circulate."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"Communities don’t have to choose between saving lives and stopping crime. The data is proof. Over 100,000 Americans now die from drug overdoses annually. To combat this crisis in New York City and save lives, Mayor Bill de Blasio decided to support an initiative rife with controversy: In November 2021, his government allowed OnPoint, a nonprofit, to open two overdose prevention centers, where people with addictions can inject or smoke drugs like opioids and stimulants under medical supervision to reduce the risk of overdose death. Upon taking office, Mayor Eric Adams, Mr. de Blasio’s successor, has continued to support the sites’ work."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"Legal challenges are pending across the country against a federal law that prevents medical marijuana users from buying or owning firearms. For Vera Cooper, the time had come to buy a gun."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"Hurricane Otis defied forecasts when it quickly transformed from a tropical storm into a Category 5 storm and slammed into the coastal city of Acapulco. Hurricane Otis exploded onto the southwest coast of Mexico early Wednesday, shocking forecasters as it emerged as one of the more powerful Category 5 storms to batter the region and create what one expert called a “nightmare scenario” for a popular tourist coastline."
Delaware,2023,Q4,"The many creative people who died this year built their wisdom over lives generously long or much too short, through times of peace and periods of conflict. Their ideas, perspectives and humanity helped shape our own: in language spoken, written or left unsaid; in notes hit, lines delivered, boundaries pushed. Here is a tribute to just some of them, in their voices.

Here is a tribute to just some of them, in their voices."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"A group of students, citing a litany of instances on campus they claimed were antisemitic, said that Harvard professors had long promulgated antisemitism in their courses, among other claims. Six students sued Harvard on Wednesday, claiming that the renowned university had become a “bastion of rampant anti-Jewish hatred and harassment” that was exacerbated by the Hamas attack on Israel last October."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"Once an undocumented sex worker and addict, she was a powerful advocate for marginalized people, and an irresistible story teller. Cecilia Gentili, a fierce advocate for transgender people and sex workers and a powerful legislative lobbyist — as well as an author and a bawdy, searing performer — died on Feb. 6 at her home in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn. She was 52."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"Native to the tropics, these pollinators are taking a lead role in one of the latest efforts to conserve the Amazon rainforest.

Together, the two then extracted honey from the nests to help cure colds and other ailments."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"Also, Russia warned against NATO forces in Ukraine. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday. Both President Biden and Donald Trump are all but assured to win their respective Michigan primaries today by large margins. But a prominent Democratic protest movement there will offer an important measure of the intraparty division facing Biden’s re-election campaign."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"The food industry has long touted its products as impossible to resist. But with a spotlight on the perils of compulsive eating, that tactic is getting another look. One day about 60 years ago, the comedian Bert Lahr put on a devil suit, held up a potato chip and uttered a phrase that would become a food-marketing milestone: “Betcha can’t eat just one.”"
Delaware,2024,Q1,"In Katherine Marsh’s new novel, the girl with the snaky curls loses neither her head nor her wits. When I teach contemporary rewritings of Greek mythology, I begin with a warning: The world these myths conjure is especially brutal for women. We read fiction about Iphigenia, sacrificed by her father, Agamemnon; about Clytemnestra, duped into sending her daughter to her death; about Briseis and the Trojan women, captured by Greek invaders and subjected to every imaginable horror. We see the lonesome drudgery of Penelope at her loom and of her doomed maids, hanged upon Odysseus’ return. The rape and banishment of Persephone, the grief of her mother, Demeter."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"Fears over skyrocketing overdoses threaten to undo Oregon’s work in establishing humane, effective drug policies. In February 2021, Oregon decriminalized possession of small amounts of all drugs, via a ballot initiative known as Measure 110. The idea was to treat addiction as a public health problem, based on overwhelming evidence that jailing people for having small amounts of drugs for personal use is both ineffective and counterproductive."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"In recent weeks, American travelers to some of the busiest international destinations during spring vacation have been urged by the State Department to exercise extra caution. Don’t wander off the resort after dark. Keep the flashy clothing and jewelry to a minimum. Stay aware of your surroundings. Those are some of the travel rules that Ginger Moore, a retired logistics analyst from Panama City, Fla., adheres to on her solo trips throughout the Caribbean."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"The special counsel opted not to pursue charges against the president but raised questions about his mental acuity, which the White House disputes. President Biden angrily hit back against a special counsel’s report on his handling of classified documents on Thursday, denying that he willfully retained papers that he was not entitled to keep and insisting that “my memory is fine” despite questions raised by the prosecutors."
Delaware,2024,Q1,"Watching Donald Trump ascend, the newly energized Biden campaign is aiming to make the general election all about him. It’s also hoping for some big endorsements. As former President Donald J. Trump speeds toward the Republican nomination, President Biden is moving quickly to pump energy into his re-election bid, kicking off what is likely to be an ugly, dispiriting and historically long slog to November between two unpopular nominees."
Delaware,2024,Q2,"The presidential candidate has faced previously undisclosed health issues, including a parasite that he said ate part of his brain. Follow live updates on the 2024 presidential election and get the latest Harris-Trump results."

Delaware,2024,Q2,"Republicans have gone after Hunter Biden for years, but his trial on gun charges undermines their views on gun rights and on a “weaponized” Justice Department. Follow our live coverage of the verdict in Hunter Biden’s gun trial."
Delaware,2024,Q2,"Age and health have drawn intensive focus in the presidential race, but the recent news that two octogenarians in the Senate are running again has prompted little discussion of their age. While President Biden tries to assuage voter concerns about his age in a presidential race that includes the two oldest men ever to seek the White House, a couple of miles away in the U.S. Senate, the gerontocracy remains alive and well — and little commented upon."
Delaware,2024,Q2,"The appearance allowed President Biden to tell the stories of love and loss that have defined his public image. Sitting with Howard Stern, the nation’s best-known shock jock, President Biden on Friday replayed the deepest lows of his life story and the highs of a decades-long political career in an appearance designed to reintroduce him to an audience of millions."
Delaware,2024,Q2,"H5N1, an avian flu virus, has killed tens of thousands of marine mammals, and infiltrated American livestock for the first time. Scientists are working quickly to assess how it is evolving and how much of a risk it poses to humans. In her three decades of working with elephant seals, Dr. Marcela Uhart had never seen anything like the scene on the beaches of Argentina’s Valdés Peninsula last October."
Delaware,2024,Q2,"The president was in New Hampshire to discuss care for veterans suffering from toxic exposure, an issue that resonates for him personally and, his campaign hopes, politically. President Biden announced on Tuesday that his administration had approved more than one million claims from veterans injured by toxic exposures during their service, actions made possible by a new law he championed, officials said."
Delaware,2024,Q2,"Basil Camu is on a mission to save trees, even the dying ones. His unconventional approach: Let it be. It’s one of the costliest actions we take in managing our landscapes — in terms of dollars and environmental damage — and yet we keep cutting down and carting away the remains of trees. Even those that pose no danger to people or property."
Delaware,2024,Q2,"Mr. Kennedy has become the most prominent independent or third-party presence in the 2024 race. The independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has emerged as a wild card of the 2024 election, attracting a motley mix of ideologically diverse supporters, raising piles of cash and drawing legal attacks from Democrats and verbal barrages from former President Donald J. Trump."
Delaware,2024,Q3,"The White House said President Biden had met with a neurologist only three times in more than three years in office, and implied that the doctor’s visits were related to treating other people. An expert on Parkinson’s disease from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center visited the White House eight times in eight months from last summer through this spring, including at least once for a meeting with President Biden’s physician, according to official visitor logs."
Delaware,2024,Q3,"Vice President Kamala Harris scooped up endorsements and wasted no time starting to build her new profile as the presumptive nominee and the new hope for defeating former President Donald J. Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris drew on her past as a prosecutor on Monday in her first campaign appearance since President Biden dropped his re-election bid, saying her law enforcement background would help her defeat a rival who is a convicted criminal."
Delaware,2024,Q3,"Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey was found guilty of bribery and corruption last week.

Delaware,2024,Q3,"The Democratic presidential ticket went to the crucial swing state on Sunday to visit areas that are competitive and somewhat more conservative.

Tim Walz of Minnesota, headed out on a brief bus tour on Sunday to fire up voters in perhaps the most crucial battleground state in the 2024 election."

Trump, joined by his new running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, repeatedly lashed out at Democrats, calling President Biden and his administration “stupid.”"
Delaware,2024,Q3,"For decades, he ran a school in the New Jersey wilderness that taught thousands of students how to survive and even thrive in the great outdoors. Tom Brown Jr., who was considered the country’s foremost authority on wilderness survival, and who taught thousands of people how to track deer, fletch arrows, forage for food and generally thrive in the great outdoors, died on Aug. 16 in Neptune, N.J. He was 74."
Delaware,2024,Q3,President Biden has repeatedly tried to erase the concerns over his age and mental acuity. But nothing has changed the narrative. Nothing President Biden did seemed to work.
Delaware,2024,Q3,"More than 200 civilian settlers on a contested island in the South China Sea find themselves on the frontier of a possible conflict with China. For travelers flying into the tiny island of Thitu, the reality of China’s territorial ambition becomes instantly clear. There they are: dozens of Chinese ships surrounding a speck of land that a few hundred Filipinos call home."
Delaware,2024,Q3,"Speaking to nearly 200 Democratic mayors, the president again acknowledged he had a poor first debate and took softball questions about his campaign and second-term agenda. President Biden held a video call with nearly 200 Democratic mayors on Tuesday night, reiterating that he was staying in the presidential race, reminding the city leaders how best to support his campaign and discussing his second-term agenda."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"Using Google’s AlphaFold, researchers identified the bundle of three sperm proteins that seem to make sexual reproduction possible. They’re the original odd couple: One is massive, spherical and unmoving. The other is tiny, has a tail and never stops swimming. Yet the union of egg and sperm is critical for every sexually reproducing animal on Earth."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"Back taxes, youthful pot smoking and undocumented nannies scuttled previous presidential choices. Some of President-elect Donald J. Trump’s candidates face bigger questions. A Supreme Court prospect bowed out after it was revealed that he had smoked pot in his youth. Two candidates for attorney general were done in when it came to light that they had employed undocumented immigrants as nannies. A third cabinet nominee — a former Senate leader no less — was nixed for not paying taxes on a car and driver lent to him by an associate. Even mean tweets were enough to sink one nominee."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"Joint events with an unpopular incumbent would “only hurt” the vice president at this stage of the campaign, as one of her advisers put it. But the president does not want to be sidelined. Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign has backed away from President Biden in the final days of the 2024 election, viewing the unpopular incumbent as a liability in her quest to succeed him, according to several White House and Harris campaign officials familiar with the planning."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"With the plans, workers are automatically enrolled and contribute through payroll deductions. The goal is to help more Americans save for retirement. Traditional pensions are increasingly rare. About half of employees at private companies don’t have access to a retirement plan. And retirees themselves say they haven’t saved enough."

Delaware,2024,Q4,"Former president Donald J. Trump has attempted to distance himself from Project 2025, the conservative policy initiative. But well over half of its contributors have worked for him, and many of its policies overlap with his. Former president Donald J. Trump has attempted to distance himself from Project 2025, the conservative policy initiative. But well over half of its contributors have worked for him, and many of its policies overlap with his."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"A pandemic relief bill set aside long-term funds for tribal lands that have lacked the tax revenue, and infrastructure, to spur businesses and wealth. Cortez, a Colorado town of about 9,000 people tucked near the San Juan Mountains, has the trappings of a humble but healthy small-town economy: bustling businesses, congenial single-family homes, a park with grassy fields, a public pool, playgrounds, a pond and skate ramps."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"New research shows that 73 “launchpad jobs” can help those without a four-year college degree advance and achieve higher pay. For decades, economic mobility in America has been declining. And those most likely to be left behind are workers without four-year college degrees."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"The biggest pharmacy benefit managers are profiting by systematically underpaying independent drugstores, creating “pharmacy deserts” across the country. The small-town drugstore closed for the last time on a clear and chilly afternoon in February. Jon Jacobs, who owned Yough Valley Pharmacy, hugged his employees goodbye. He cleared the shelves and packed pill bottles into plastic bins."
Delaware,2024,Q4,"Plus, an interview with the Taliban’s most fearsome leader. With less than two weeks left before Election Day, Kamala Harris is pulling out big names to drive her supporters to the polls. She’ll hold a rally in Georgia with Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen in the coming hours. And tomorrow, she’ll share the stage with Beyoncé at a rally in Texas."
District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"As the coronavirus upends the economy, the Trump administration plans to make changes to the food stamp program that could lead to nearly 700,000 people losing assistance. WASHINGTON — Despite the worsening pandemic, the Trump administration is pushing ahead with tougher work requirements for food stamps, and so far has not offered states the opportunity to cover the uninsured on an emergency basis under Medicaid."
District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"More coronavirus care will be covered in many states. Federal officials are considering similar action for the state markets they run. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have opened enrollment under the Affordable Care Act to allow laid-off workers to get subsidized health insurance, and the Trump administration, which has been gunning to repeal the law, is considering opening the federal exchange to new customers."
District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"Many lawmakers are over 65, but congressional business continues, in conflict with public health guidelines. Public health officials concerned about the new coronavirus have been warning people over 65 to avoid crowds, limit physical contact with others and skip “nonessential travel.”"
District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"Medicaid expansion is just the latest example of how liberal policies make for good politics. When left-wing Democrats push for universal benefits and expansive new policies, they do so with a theory of politics in mind. It goes like this: The reason to fight for debt-free college or Medicare for all isn’t just to improve life for Americans, but to build new ground for progressive political activity. New programs create new constituencies, and new programs with broad benefits can give more Americans a stake in the expansion and preservation of the welfare state. Conservatives know this. That’s why they’ve fought so hard to block or undermine even modest new programs."

District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"With no detailed government database on where the thousands of coronavirus cases have been reported, a team of New York Times journalists is attempting to track every case.

District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"The ruling centers on marketing practices for a kind of medical device that has prompted years of personal injury litigation and billions in payouts. Johnson & Johnson should pay $344 million in damages because the company deceptively marketed transvaginal pelvic mesh implants to tens of thousands of women in California, a judge ruled Thursday."
District of Columbia,2020,Q1,"The Agriculture Department proposed a rule that would further unravel nutrition standards set by Mrs. Obama when she was first lady.

District of Columbia,2020,Q2,"“It is hard to put fully into words what we are all grappling with as we navigate our way through this pandemic,” a hospital official said. New York, the increasingly battered epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus outbreak, on Friday reported its highest number of deaths in a single day, prompting state officials to beg the rest of the United States for assistance and to enact an emergency order designed to stave off medical catastrophe."
District of Columbia,2020,Q2,"The majority leader’s plan to reconvene next week carries dangers for lawmakers as well as workers at the Capitol, where many low-level employees are minorities and at greater risk from Covid-19. WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats assailed Senator Mitch McConnell on Thursday for insisting on bringing the Senate back to Washington in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic, saying it could imperil not only senators and their aides, but also large numbers of low-level employees, including racial minorities at higher risk of infection and death from Covid-19."
District of Columbia,2020,Q2,"Teachers at some schools across the country report that fewer than half of their students are participating in online learning. Chronic absenteeism is a problem in American education during the best of times, but now, with the vast majority of the nation’s school buildings closed and lessons being conducted remotely, more students than ever are missing class — not logging on, not checking in or not completing assignments."
District of Columbia,2020,Q2,"Antibodies to the virus faded quickly in asymptomatic people, scientists reported. That does not mean immunity disappears. It’s a question that has haunted scientists since the pandemic began: Does everyone infected with the virus produce antibodies — and if so, how long do they last?"
District of Columbia,2020,Q2,"In states with many uninsured citizens, few hospitals and leaders who have not required citizens to stay home, a disaster is looming. NASHVILLE — On March 22, when Nashville’s mayor John Cooper closed nonessential businesses here, it was a terrible blow to companies and shops still reeling from the tornado that tore through Middle Tennessee on Super Tuesday. Small businesses struggle in the best of times, and a one-two punch like that — a natural disaster followed by a lethal pandemic — will almost certainly force some of them to close for good."
District of Columbia,2020,Q2,A federal district judge has ruled that the Agriculture Department’s regulation easing sodium and whole-grain standards in school meals violated regulatory law.

Rebuffing strong opposition from industry, California on Thursday adopted a landmark rule requiring more than half of all trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035, a move that is expected to improve local air quality, rein in greenhouse gas emissions and sharply curtail the state’s dependence on oil."
District of Columbia,2020,Q3,A federal judge ruled that the Constitution protected the right of the House of Representatives to make its own rules.

District of Columbia,2020,Q3,"Nearly all the buildings remained open, following city guidelines that say only those schools with two cases in different classrooms will shut. At least one coronavirus case had been reported in more than 100 school buildings and early childhood centers in the New York City school system by the first day of in-person instruction on Monday, according to the Department of Education."
District of Columbia,2020,Q3,"Not all schools will be able to restart. For those that can, the focus should be on more than just the classroom. As we wrestle in the next few weeks over which of the nation’s schools to reopen — and let’s be clear, not all of them will be safe to restart — we need to understand this: Kindergarten through the 12th grade involves more than just the classroom."
District of Columbia,2020,Q3,"The gap between rates set for private insurers and employers vs. those by the federal government stirs the debate over a government-run health plan. Hospitals across the country are charging private insurance companies 2.5 times what they get from Medicare for the same care, according to a new RAND Corporation study of hospital prices released on Friday."

District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"Mr. Becerra was the first in his family to go to college. As attorney general of California, he took on the Trump administration on nearly every front. But can he take on the pandemic? SACRAMENTO — Four years ago, when a veteran California congressman, Xavier Becerra, came home to become the state’s attorney general, eyebrows rose — not in disapproval, but surprise."
District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"The government needs stringent standards for how states report Covid-19 testing. The United States is more than eight months into the pandemic and people are back waiting in long lines to be tested as coronavirus infections surge again. And yet there is still no federal standard to ensure testing results are being uniformly reported. Without uniform results, it is impossible to track cases accurately or respond effectively."
District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"The outbreak at the White House and on Capitol Hill underscored how difficult it is for a city with almost no control over the federal government it houses to sustain progress. WASHINGTON — In recent months, as coronavirus cases rose around the country, the nation’s capital and most of its surrounding suburbs managed to bring infection rates down, through strict preventive laws and a largely compliant population."
District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"The legislature in this battleground state could flip to Democratic control, a prospect that is bringing out lower-income voters who stayed home in 2016. [Follow our live Capitol building lockdown reporter discussion here.]"

District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"Some pharmaceutical companies are scaling back their participation in a federally mandated drug discount program. State attorneys general are demanding that the administration take action. WASHINGTON — Some of the nation’s top pharmaceutical companies have stopped giving federally mandated drug discounts to hospitals and clinics that care for the poorest Americans, a move that is prompting bipartisan calls for the health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, to demand reinstatement of the price breaks or punish the firms."
District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"Technology to alert people exposed to the virus could slow transmission, pilot studies show, but only if people and states sign up. So far, most haven’t. Last spring, Apple and Google launched an ambitious effort to harness technology in the fight against Covid-19, building a powerful smartphone tool that would alert people of possible exposure to the coronavirus."
District of Columbia,2020,Q4,"“You know you’re going to be my boyfriend, right?” Jaime Oliva asked Edward Williams, long before they began dating. Mr. Williams brushed him off at first but eventually had a change of heart. Jaime Oliva stepped out of an Uber and into harm’s way. Mr. Oliva, 30, a senior adviser for strategic management at the Department of Health and Human Services, was returning to his Washington office and looking razor sharp after visiting his barber in July 2017."

District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"Read more about the plans by top officials to move toward something resembling normalcy. The coronavirus pandemic has crippled economies, shut down travel and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, transforming the world in ways that would have been unthinkable a year ago.

District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"Seven districts, seven very different experiences of pandemic learning. For the past few months, my colleagues have worked on a sweeping project on the state of American education. They wanted to address a simple question, said James Dao, a national editor at The Times who oversees education coverage: “Are American children getting adequate schooling in the pandemic?”"
District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"Although low-income communities of color have been affected disproportionately by the coronavirus, health officials in many cities say that people from wealthier, largely white neighborhoods have been flooding vaccination appointment systems and taking an outsize share of the limited supply.

District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"Many Americans know they’ve put on weight during the pandemic, but it’s been difficult for experts to detail the scope of the problem. Soon after the pandemic started over a year ago, Americans started joking about the dreaded “quarantine 15,” worried they might gain weight while shut in homes with stockpiles of food, glued to computer screens and binge-watching Netflix."
District of Columbia,2021,Q1,Large swaths of the United States still refuse to follow simple advice from experts. The next phase of the pandemic in the United States will most likely be determined by two factors: the new virus variants and the vaccine rollout.
District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"The OxyContin maker filed its long-awaited restructuring plan in bankruptcy court. Revenue from the new company would go exclusively to abating the opioid crisis. In a filing that signifies the beginning of the end of the country’s most notorious manufacturer of prescription opioids, Purdue Pharma submitted its bankruptcy restructuring plan just before midnight on Monday. The blueprint requires members of the billionaire Sackler family to relinquish control of the company and transforms it into a new corporation with revenue directed exclusively toward abating the addiction epidemic that its signature painkiller, OxyContin, helped create."
District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"In the United States, the vaccination rates for Black and Hispanic people are far outpaced by that of white people, according to a New York Times analysis.

District of Columbia,2021,Q1,"Deep-seated mistrust among Black families toward their public school districts is holding back school reopening, even as Black children suffer inordinately from remote learning.

District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"Mask mandates are often the last pandemic public health order to be lifted, as stay-at-home orders and forced business closures become a thing of the past. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered on Tuesday new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors, people across the United States are living under an often confusing patchwork of limits, one that could continue for some time."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"The C.D.C. had imposed an eviction moratorium, saying it was needed to address the coronavirus pandemic.

District of Columbia,2021,Q2,Scores of appointments were canceled after the U.S. called for a halt on the use of the Johnson & Johnson shot. Here’s the story behind that decision. Federal health agencies have called for a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus shot while they examine a rare blood-clotting disorder that emerged in six women who received the vaccine.
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,The moves come as President Biden pushed up the deadline to make all adults eligible for a vaccine and as the pace of inoculations is accelerating in the country. New Hampshire and Oklahoma announced plans this week to open up vaccine eligibility to outside residents as supply grows and more states expand eligibility.
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"The Biden administration will appeal the ruling against the policy, which has been the subject of legal challenges by landlords. WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Wednesday struck down the nationwide moratorium on evictions imposed by the Trump administration last year and extended by President Biden until June 30, a ruling that could affect tenants struggling to pay rent during the pandemic."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"Only two in five federal inmates have gotten at least one shot so far, compared with three-fifths of adults nationwide. Despite the elevated risk behind bars, mistrust and refusal rates run high. Vaccinations in many American prisons, jails and detention centers are lagging far behind the United States as a whole, prompting public health officials to worry that these settings will remain fertile ground for frequent, fast-spreading coronavirus outbreaks for a long time to come."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"OSHA has saved many lives in its 50 years. But it can do more. Fifty years ago today, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration opened its doors, American workplaces were full of dangers. In 1970, an average of 38 workers were killed on the job every day, and many thousands more were injured or sickened by exposures to toxic chemicals. The law that created OSHA was revolutionary: It established, for the first time, the right to a safe workplace, free of serious hazards. Businesses had to comply with federal regulations and permit inspectors to examine their facilities."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"Philadelphia is demonstrating how cities can help tenants and landlords. Halting most evictions during the coronavirus pandemic was a necessary act of emergency medicine. Federal, state and local moratoriums allowed millions of Americans to stay in their homes when they couldn’t afford to pay rent. But that success is now at risk of unraveling."
District of Columbia,2021,Q2,"There is an effective approach to breaking the preschool-to-prison pipeline. The boy I’ll call Jackson is the kind of youngster who drives a preschool teacher around the bend. The 4-year-old bites and hits other children, and curses out his teacher, Mariana Lopez. During circle time, when the class is supposed to cluster around and listen to one another, he is a hellion, and nap time turns into a pitched battle. Preschool teachers rely on parents to relate what’s happening on the home front, but Jackson’s mom refused to meet with Ms. Lopez because she felt her son was being persecuted."

District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"Mask mandates protect children only when masking is universal. This is not a hard concept to understand.

Trump stormed the Capitol, the United States Capitol Police is planning to expand operations outside Washington in an effort to better protect lawmakers, beginning with the opening of field offices in California and Florida."
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,The company faces declining sales and thousands of lawsuits claiming it knowingly sold its trendy vaping products to minors.

Many state and local lobbying campaigns have been shut down.
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"In California and New York, where mandates for health care workers have gone into effect, many are complying. SACRAMENTO — As California’s requirement that all health care workers be vaccinated against the coronavirus took effect on Thursday, major health systems reported that the mandate had helped boost their vaccination rates to 90 percent or higher. In New York, another mandate that began this week compelled thousands of hospital and nursing home workers to get shots. And at several major corporations, executives reported surges in vaccination rates after adding their own requirements."
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"Some parents feel awkward and reluctant to discuss bodies, consent and sexuality; their kids pay the price. When a friend of mine took her kids to the pediatrician’s office a few weeks ago, her 7-year-old daughter noticed a birth-control poster and asked her about it. Soon after, her 4-year-old son began peppering her with sex questions too: “But Mom, why would a penis ever go into a vagina? Did Dad put his penis into your vagina?”"

District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"The effort follows the unionization of several 2020 Democratic presidential campaigns, and will make the D.N.C. the first national party group to have an organized work force. Staff members at the Democratic National Committee are set to be represented by a union, the first time a national party organization will have a unionized work force, committee officials said on Tuesday."
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"The agreement would allow funds to begin flowing from the companies to states and communities to pay for addiction and prevention services. After nearly two years of wrangling, the country’s three major drug distributors and a pharmaceutical giant have reached a $26 billion deal with states that would release some of the biggest companies in the industry from all civil liability in the opioid epidemic, a decades-long public health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans."
District of Columbia,2021,Q3,"The military and the Department of Veterans Affairs report higher inoculation rates, as do some companies and states, but they have a long way to go. WASHINGTON — President Biden’s new coronavirus vaccination mandates have prompted some backlash, but the two federal departments that already require vaccinations say their actions are doing what they intended: getting more shots in arms."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"The looming wave is shaking the rickety infrastructure that has kept schools running. This is our final Education Briefing newsletter for 2021 — and it’s sobering to have to end the year with a look at another wave of Covid, and the toll on the mental health of our students."

District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"Average blood pressure readings increased as the coronavirus spread, new research suggests. The finding portends medical repercussions far beyond Covid-19. Last year was a tough one. Americans grappled with a global pandemic, the loss of loved ones, lockdowns that splintered social networks, stress, unemployment and depression."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"A district in London has developed an innovative way to divert subway heat for buildings to lower carbon emissions. Other cities are getting creative, as well. The London Underground is the oldest subway system in the world, so it might seem an unlikely source of innovation for one of the thorniest problems facing humanity in the 21st century: climate change."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"The states were examining whether the actions of Facebook, now called Meta, violated state consumer protection laws and put the public at risk. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general said on Thursday they had opened an investigation into Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, for promoting its social media app Instagram while knowing of mental and emotional harms caused by the service."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"The U.S. is one of six countries with no national paid leave. The Democrats have cut their plan to four weeks, which would still make it an outlier. Congress is now considering four weeks of paid family and medical leave, down from the 12 weeks that were initially proposed in the Democrats’ spending plan. If the plan becomes law, the United States will no longer be one of six countries in the world — and the only rich country — without any form of national paid leave."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"Home health care workers must now be vaccinated in New York State. It’s Friday. We’ll look at a the new mandate that covers some 250,000 home health care workers. We’ll also look at an opera by and for trees."
District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"Assemblyman Dick Gottfried, the longest-serving state lawmaker in New York’s history, pushed progressive proposals decades before they won momentum in Albany.

District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"Frome, a town in England, has taken an innovative approach to mental health with its fight against loneliness.

District of Columbia,2021,Q4,"Images of Border Patrol agents corralling Black migrants prompted criticism of the Biden administration’s response to an influx of thousands in Del Rio, Texas. WASHINGTON — Mirard Joseph was bringing food to his wife and child, he said, when a Border Patrol agent on horseback in Del Rio, Texas, “lashed at” him with his reins and dragged him by the collar toward the Rio Grande, which in that region separates the United States from Mexico."
District of Columbia,2022,Q1,"Some scientists and health experts see the possibility that the first signs of a new surge could be missed, but others say metrics like hospitalizations and wastewater monitoring have become more relevant than daily reports. A growing number of U.S. states have stopped giving daily updates of the number of new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths, which, combined with the rise of at-home testing whose results are often not officially registered, is creating a more uneven real-time look at the state of the pandemic."
District of Columbia,2022,Q1,"The police said they had gone to a home in Washington to investigate a tip about “potential biohazard material” when officers found the fetuses inside. An investigation was continuing.

District of Columbia,2022,Q1,"Mayor Eric Adams plans to end certain mask and vaccine mandates in hopes of restoring a sense of normalcy. Some health experts think he should wait.

District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"The company is appealing the F.D.A.’s decision to ban sales of its vaping products.

District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"We must acknowledge the role that race plays in sexual and reproductive health outcomes in this country.

District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"The virus “is not known to linger in the air,” agency officials said. But the research is far from definitive.

Wade reversal gave way to a coast-to-coast wave of lawsuits, legislation and pitched political fights. "
District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"The nation’s largest airlines dropped the requirement within hours of the ruling, but New York’s M.T.A. said its passengers must still wear a mask for now. WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Florida struck down the  mask requirement on airplanes, trains, buses and other public transportation on Monday, less than a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had extended it through May 3."
District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"But prior infection does not guarantee protection from the virus, officials said, and Americans should still get vaccinated and boosted. Sixty percent of Americans, including 75 percent of children, had been infected with the coronavirus by February, federal health officials reported on Tuesday — another remarkable milestone in a pandemic that continues to confound expectations."
District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"Even as cases rise, genetic analysis suggests that the virus has been silently circulating in people since 2018. When the first monkeypox cases were identified in early May, European health officials were stumped. The virus was not known to spread easily among people, let alone infect dozens — and soon hundreds — of young men."
District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"About two dozen American researchers focus exclusively on how to prevent gun violence. They have waged an often-frustrating battle to translate their findings into public policy. CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Jeffrey W. Swanson, a sociologist at Duke University, is no stranger to Washington’s gun laws debate. He has been studying violence and mental illness for more than 30 years, building a scientific case for policies that might reduce gun deaths."
District of Columbia,2022,Q2,"It was not clear what led to the shooting or where the student had obtained a handgun. The two students were familiar with each other, the authorities said. The authorities are investigating the fatal shooting of a 12-year-old student on Thursday by a classmate at their South Carolina middle school."
District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"Did you text Mom recently asking if you had been vaccinated against polio? So did we. Michelle Tynan, 32, texted her mother a question last week that had never crossed her mind before: Had she received the polio vaccine?"
District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"There are ways to figure out what you’ve been vaccinated for, even if you have no hope of finding the original records. Melinda Wenner Moyer is out this week. I’m Knvul Sheikh, a reporter on the Well desk, filling in today."
District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"The Biden administration is suing to block Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster. A United States District Court will decide if the sale can proceed.

District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"More school employees are carrying guns to defend against school shootings. In Ohio, a contentious new law requires no more than 24 hours of training.

District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"In her memoir, “Dinners With Ruth,” the NPR journalist writes about their parallel ascents in fields that were not friendly to women. In “Dinners With Ruth,” Nina Totenberg, the legendary NPR journalist who was close to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writes about the nature of friendship — and it’s easy to see why she might feel she has expertise in the subject."
District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"This congressional race in Washington State shows the November elections in microcosm. VANCOUVER, Wash. — In March, five months before he became the Republican nominee in a Washington State congressional race, Joe Kent appeared on a webcast hosted by a Gen-Z white nationalist group called the American Populist Union. Kent, who would soon be endorsed by Donald Trump, was there to explain his disavowal of Nick Fuentes, a smirking 24-year-old far-right influencer whom The New York Times has described as “a prominent white supremacist.”"
District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"The Equal Rights Amendment prohibits discrimination against anyone based on race, ethnicity, national origin, disability or sex — specifically sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and pregnancy. ALBANY, N.Y. — The New York State Legislature on Friday passed a measure that, if fully enacted, would enshrine in the State Constitution the right to seek an abortion and access contraception."
District of Columbia,2022,Q3,"The California governor must decide about labor bills and a sweeping measure to seal criminal records, matters that have drawn intense lobbying from both sides. The countdown has begun."
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"The temporary stay in lifting the pandemic rule known as Title 42 is a provisional victory for 19 states, led mostly by Republicans, that had sought to keep it in place on the border. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said on Tuesday that a pandemic-era health measure that restricted migration at the southern border would remain in place for the time being, delaying the potential for a huge increase in unlawful crossings."
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"From his powerful perch on the D.C. appeals court, he voided gun controls and challenged press freedoms but also upheld the Affordable Care Act. Laurence H. Silberman, a conservative federal appeals court judge and advocate of judicial restraint whose opinions on guns rights, press freedom, the Affordable Care Act and other crucial issues resonated widely and sometimes presaged Supreme Court decisions, died on Sunday at his home in Washington. He was 86."
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,The reversal of a district judge’s intervention in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation shows the complexity of former President Donald J. Trump’s judicial legacy. WASHINGTON — A scathing decision on Thursday by a federal appeals court panel that shut down a lower court judge’s interference in a criminal investigation involving former President Donald J. Trump has highlighted a question: Is there such a thing as a Trump judge?
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"A sprawling book by the journalist Andrew Meier traces four generations of epoch-making Morgenthaus, culminating in the life of the borough’s longest-serving district attorney. What makes a family dynasty? It starts with multigenerational success, of course, but it usually takes something more — a sense of common mission. The Kennedys and Bushes haven’t just reached great heights; they’ve stood for something, or at least they’ve created the expectation that they do. In “Morgenthau,” Andrew Meier makes a 1,046-page case for a different kind of dynasty, one where the protagonists have little in common except their inherited privilege."
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"A system counting tips toward the minimum wage is being fought in many places. Critics say it’s often abused. Defenders say workers benefit overall. With Americans resuming prepandemic habits of going out, eating out and traveling, leisure and hospitality businesses have scrambled to hire, sometimes offering pay increases that outpace inflation."
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,How to make sense of the results. Perhaps the only certainty about today’s midterm elections — which will determine control of American government at all levels and shape democracy’s future — is that the polls will close tonight.
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"In a win for the Biden administration, the United States Postal Service said it would spend nearly $10 billion to create one of the largest electric truck fleets in the nation. WASHINGTON — The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it planned to buy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, creating one of the largest battery-powered fleets in the nation and resolving a long-running dispute with the Biden administration over how quickly the agency should clean up its fleet of iconic white, red and blue mail trucks."
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"Groundbreakers at the conference were asked what’s coming next for the brain, climate, medicine, labor, security and business. For last week’s DealBook conference in New York City, The New York Times invited leaders in an array of disciplines to gather together to talk about some of the most pressing challenges they see as they look to the future in their areas of expertise. We asked them similar questions in advance. Their answers, which have been edited and condensed, are included here."
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"What seemed like a transitory step to avoid infection has become a major force driving the future direction of urban America. The past 30 years “were a golden era for large cities,” Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, a professor of real estate and finance at Columbia Business School, wrote in November 2022: “A virtuous cycle of improving amenities (educational and cultural institutions, entertainment, low crime) and job opportunities attracted employers, employees, young and old, to cities.”"
District of Columbia,2022,Q4,"Mold in homes is a costly crisis that often accompanies hurricanes and flooding, and climate change is amplifying the rain that feeds outbreaks. On Tuesday morning, six days after Hurricane Ian tore through southwestern Florida, Alvaro “Moe” Zuluaga and his team of mold remediators walked through a house in Naples. The walls were cheerfully painted in sunny yellows and palm greens, and beyond a suspiciously musty smell there was little immediate sign that just days before, the entire home had been sitting in a foot of floodwater."
District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"After two years championing progressive priorities, the president is speaking more to the concerns of the political middle as he prepares to announce a campaign for a second term. WASHINGTON — In his announcement video kicking off his presidential campaign in the spring of 2019, Joseph R. Biden Jr. never mentioned the word “deficit.” Nor did the word escape his lips when he accepted the Democratic Party nomination a year later. Nor did it appear once in the party platform he approved."
District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"The National Restaurant Association uses mandatory $15 food-safety classes to turn waiters and cooks into unwitting funders of its battle against minimum wage increases.

District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"Many of the nation’s major cities face a daunting future. On the last day of February, Glen Lee, the chief financial officer of Washington, D.C., issued a warning to the mayor and members of the District of Columbia Council, who are undertaking such costly ventures as free bus service and expanded affordable housing."
District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"A veterinary tranquilizer called xylazine is infiltrating street drugs, deepening addiction, baffling law enforcement and causing wounds so severe that some result in amputation. PHILADELPHIA — Over a matter of weeks, Tracey McCann watched in horror as the bruises she was accustomed to getting from injecting fentanyl began hardening into an armor of crusty, blackened tissue. Something must have gotten into the supply."
District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"“Granny flats” are popping up in backyards across the country, affording Americans a new housing option. Some communities are not happy about it. Forty-five years ago, Betty Szudy and her wife, Maggie Roth, both 70, bought a Craftsman bungalow in Oakland, Calif. In 2017, at the same time their son and his wife were fruitlessly searching for an affordable apartment in the neighborhood, California was liberalizing its housing laws to encourage so-called accessory dwelling units, or A.D.U.s."

District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"In cities like Detroit and Philadelphia, markets have become year-round destinations, offering classes, crafts and music, as well as a surprising array of fresh produce. On a recent Saturday morning at Eastern Market in Detroit, busking musicians filled the air with jazz as vendors finished setting up for the day’s traffic. Shoppers streamed in, sizing up winter produce, relishes and chutneys, fresh cuts of beef and more."
District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"Wild animals eat the strangest things. That can be a problem, for them and for us. In September 1985, the authorities discovered the body of Andrew Thornton, a drug smuggler, in a Tennessee backyard. He had a bag full of cocaine, a failed parachute and the key to a small airplane, which turned up at a crash site about 60 miles away."
District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"Sixteen young Montanans have sued their state, arguing that its support of fossil fuels violates the state Constitution. KALISPELL, Mont. — Badge and Lander Busse tromped into the forest behind their house on a snowy Sunday in March, their three hunting dogs in tow. It was in these woods, just outside Glacier National Park, that the teenage boys learned to hunt, fish, dress a deer and pick birdshot from Hungarian partridges."
District of Columbia,2023,Q1,"Thrust into the role of spokesman after the assassination attempt in 1981, he led televised medical briefings that reassured an anxious nation.

He was 85."
District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"The justices are poised to consider whether the most common method of ending pregnancies can be sharply curtailed in states where abortion remains legal. Less than a year after the Supreme Court declared it was ceding the matter of abortion to elected officials, the justices are poised to consider whether the most common method of ending pregnancies can be sharply curtailed in states where abortion remains legal, not just where it is illegal."
District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"Fixing the background check system can be done today, but it will take work. A litany of exasperating rituals flows from America’s regular mass shootings. One of the most frustrating is the hand-wringing that our politics is so polarized that there’s no way to move forward."
District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"The drug will remain widely available as the justices extended their deadline to Friday on whether to uphold the F.D.A.’s approval of the pill.

District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"The change, signed into law by the state’s governor, followed a legal challenge brought by a 75-year-old Connecticut resident.

District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"The opinion from a federal judge in Texas is a legal travesty. The Friday-night ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk purporting to stay the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone for use in early abortions is a travesty — for women’s health care, principles of democracy, notions of judicial impartiality and the rule of law."
District of Columbia,2023,Q2,"Experts call it a consequential change in the care of some older people and others with limits on their mental functioning. Conservative Texans and liberal Californians disagree on much in politics. But legislators in both states agree on a new approach to giving people with cognitive impairments a greater chance for self-determination. It’s called supported decision-making, and it is shaping up to be the most consequential change in the care of older people and others with limitations in mental functioning since the rise of advance care directives in the 1990s."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"The help that caregivers need goes far beyond the nuts and bolts of caregiving and its financial costs. Most people don’t like to think about growing old. But when asked, most Americans 55 or older say they want to do so at home. The appeal is understandable. Aging in place, surrounded by familiar places, faces and memories, can provide a sense of comfort and independence. It may seem a modest ambition, but the logistical and economic realities are daunting. Even healthy older people may struggle with basic tasks of daily life, so most of them will, at some point, require help from a caregiver, paid or unpaid, to remain at home."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"The Army colonel overseeing the court-martial trial had applied for a job with the Trump-era Justice Department, raising the appearance of bias. A federal judge on Tuesday wiped out the conviction and sentence of Bowe Bergdahl, the former Army sergeant who walked off a base in Afghanistan in 2009 only to be held captive by the Taliban for five years, and whose release in a prisoner swap prompted intense controversy."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"Wildfires in western Canada are expected to create smoky conditions in the United States this week. Parts of the U.S. had unhealthy air in June from wildfires in other parts of Canada.

District of Columbia,2023,Q3,The court found that young people have a constitutional right to a healthful environment and that the state must consider potential climate damage when approving projects. A group of young people in Montana won a landmark lawsuit on Monday when a judge ruled that the state’s failure to consider climate change when approving fossil fuel projects was unconstitutional.
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"The plaintiffs want the state to drop its residency requirement. Oregon and Vermont have already done so. Judy Govatos has heard that magical phrase “you’re in remission” twice, in 2015 and again in 2019. She had beaten back Stage 4 lymphoma with such aggressive chemotherapy and other treatments that at one point she grew too weak to stand, and relied on a wheelchair. She endured several hospitalizations, suffered infections and lost nearly 20 pounds. But she prevailed."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,"As a founder of the San Francisco band It’s a Beautiful Day, he was at the center, if not in the forefront, of the Haight-Ashbury acid-rock explosion. David LaFlamme, who infused the psychedelic rock of the 1960s with the plaintive sounds of an electric violin as a founder of It’s a Beautiful Day, the ethereal San Francisco band whose breakout hit, “White Bird,” encapsulated the hippie-era longing for freedom, died on Aug. 6 in Santa Rosa, Calif. He was 82."
District of Columbia,2023,Q3,A judge’s decision to limit how the administration can interact with platforms could chill the White House’s efforts to utilize and police big tech.

District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"The city’s $26 million contract with Talkspace makes mental health care very accessible. But some worry it is ‘a Band-Aid’ at a time of crisis. For the past month, New York City has been inviting teenagers to participate in one of the biggest experiments in the country aimed at helping struggling adolescents: a program offering free online therapy to all residents ages 13 to 17."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"Despite holding more than 700 votes this year, the House only managed to pass 27 bills that have made it into law, thanks to tiny majorities, divided government and a right wing bent on constraining government. In a year of divided government, when House Republicans were even divided against themselves, Congress was historically unproductive. The House has passed just 27 bills that were signed into law by President Biden. Still to come is the annual military policy bill that the House cleared for Mr. Biden last week but he has yet to sign."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"The administration’s “good neighbor” rule on cross-state pollution, meant to protect downwind states from harmful emissions, faces a legal challenge.

House Republicans voted this afternoon to nominate Tom Emmer — a Representative from Minnesota who holds the No. 3 leadership post — to be the chamber’s next speaker. But within hours, he dropped his bid."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"A recent change in antitrust law made it easier for the singers to bypass big movie studios when seeking distribution for their concert films. Just before Taylor Swift’s concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” passed $100 million in global ticket presales this week, its distributor, AMC Entertainment, announced that it had struck a similar deal with Beyoncé for the singer’s Renaissance tour. Both projects follow tours that became cultural phenomena and pushed sales records, and the films are expected to be hits themselves."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,"The court should embrace the art of judicial statecraft. A generation after the Supreme Court stepped into a disputed presidential election, America is experiencing a creeping sense of déjà vu. Twenty-three years ago, a bare majority of the justices halted a recount in Florida, effectively handing the presidency to George W. Bush."
District of Columbia,2023,Q4,The president is visiting the country as the Middle East reels from an explosion at a Gazan hospital.

District of Columbia,2024,Q1,"Also, a Columbia surgeon published flawed studies. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday.

District of Columbia,2024,Q1,"Complaints have been mounting on social media, and now a group has filed a lawsuit, as the service has continued rolling out policies against accepting cash to enter federal parks. At dozens of national parks and historic sites around the United States, getting away from it all to revel in the country’s wide open spaces has taken on a whole new meaning."
District of Columbia,2024,Q1,"Democrats rejected almost all of House Republicans’ marquee policy demands. But G.O.P. negotiators forced some spending cuts, including to the E.P.A. and the F.B.I.

District of Columbia,2024,Q2,"With support from demonstrators in Lower Manhattan spotty so far, Donald Trump issued a call to “rally behind MAGA,” and suggested the poor turnout was a result of a plot against his supporters.

District of Columbia,2024,Q2,"Even as transit systems nationwide struggle, New York City’s transportation network appeared to finally score a major win with the now-paused tolling program. In a country where the car is still king, New York had stirred hope that an ambitious policy prioritizing mass transit was possible."
District of Columbia,2024,Q2,"Four cases backed by conservative activists in recent years have combined to diminish the power of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Larnell Robinson sat at a desk in his cluttered office last September, between a bookshelf full of Bibles and a table stacked with the overdose antidote Narcan. He slid out a list of residents of the West Baltimore high-rise where he was tenant council president — one of dozens of subsidized complexes that house the city’s poor seniors. One by one, he began scratching through names, conducting a grim accounting of the dead."

Florida,2022,Q1,"A spat over Covid has exposed friction between the former president and a rising G.O.P. governor unwilling to curb his ambitions. For months, former President Donald J. Trump has been grumbling quietly to friends and visitors to his Palm Beach mansion about a rival Republican power center in another Florida mansion, some 400 miles to the north."
Florida,2022,Q1,"As a medical student, Dr. Farmer decided to build a clinic in Haiti. It grew into a vast network serving some of the world’s poorest communities. Paul Farmer, a physician, anthropologist and humanitarian who gained global acclaim for his work delivering high-quality health care to some of the world’s poorest people, died on Monday on the grounds of a hospital and university he had helped establish in Butaro, Rwanda. He was 62."
Florida,2022,Q1,"Education made me hate myself less. Last October, I attended a high school Halloween party. A group of guys from my school surrounded me and shouted homophobic slurs. One even threatened me with physical violence. When I broke down crying in class the next day, my teacher comforted me. She told me that she had gone through something similar when she was my age."
Florida,2022,Q1,"The cadets, along with another young man, were exposed to what is believed to be cocaine laced with fentanyl, and two were on ventilators late Friday, officials said. Several West Point cadets were among six young men on spring break who overdosed this week on what was believed to be cocaine laced with fentanyl at a rental home in Wilton Manors, Fla., officials said Friday."
Florida,2022,Q1,"The “Plan to Rescue America” is dividing the party and cheering Democrats, and its author, Senate Republicans’ top campaign official, won’t stop talking about it. WASHINGTON — Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the somewhat embattled head of the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, said one utterly indisputable thing on Thursday when he stood before a packed auditorium of supporters at the conservative Heritage Foundation: His plan for a G.O.P. majority would make everyone angry at him, Republicans included."
Florida,2022,Q1,"Stores are shortening hours, fitting rooms are being closed and some employees can’t go on break. “Morale could not be lower,” one retail worker said. Long checkout lines. Closed fitting rooms. Empty shelves. Shortened store hours."
Florida,2022,Q2,"The state was once a refuge for the procedure in the Southeast. Florida, the nation’s third-most populous state, also has the third-highest abortion rate, after New York and Illinois. Friday’s Supreme Court ruling and recent actions by Republican state leaders are expected to soon change that."
Florida,2022,Q2,"Federal rules make it hard for relatives of people with job-based coverage to qualify for financial help in buying Obamacare insurance. The Biden administration wants to change that. A “family glitch” sounds like a minor mix-up, like missing dinner. But when talking about health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, it means a costly loophole."
Florida,2022,Q2,"It was not immediately clear how much the State Health Department’s decision not to take part in distributing the pediatric shots would impede access to them in Florida in the coming days. Florida did not preorder any doses of coronavirus vaccines for very young children from the federal government, state officials said Thursday, arguing that the state had no need to be involved in what they called a “convoluted vaccine distribution process.”"
Florida,2022,Q2,"The ban, passed by Republican lawmakers and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, is scheduled to take effect on Friday. MIAMI — In a welcome but likely brief victory for supporters of abortion rights, a judge in Florida blocked a state law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy on Thursday, the latest in a flurry of activity in state courts and legislatures following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade."
Florida,2022,Q2,"The state has become an unlikely laboratory for right-wing policy, pushed by a governor with presidential ambitions. MIAMI — Florida feels like a state running a fever, its very identity changing at a frenetic pace."
Florida,2022,Q2,"Florida health officials told Special Olympics that the vaccine requirement violated state law. Special Olympics lifted its coronavirus vaccine requirement for athletes and staff members at its U.S.A. Games in Orlando, Fla., this weekend after Florida threatened a $27.5 million fine over the mandate."
Florida,2022,Q2,"Unlike the other 49 states and the District of Columbia, Florida did not allow health care providers to preorder the vaccines ahead of the federal government’s June 14 deadline. Facing withering pressure from medical professionals and the federal government, Florida began to allow pediatricians, children’s hospitals and other physicians on Friday to order coronavirus vaccines for the youngest children, according to state and White House officials. The shift would ensure that families would be able to get the shots at doctors’ offices, though later than in every other state in the country."
Florida,2022,Q2,"Fifteen people have now been charged in a fraud scheme that sold drugs to treat cancer, H.I.V. and psychiatric conditions. One was charged with distributing more than $230 million in adulterated H.I.V. drugs. Two Florida men were charged last week in widespread prescription fraud cases that could have left unsuspecting patients across the country without the proper medication to treat cancer, H.I.V. and psychiatric conditions, according to federal officials."
Florida,2022,Q2,"The Planned Parenthood clinic in Fort Myers, Fla., has seen an increase in patients arriving from Texas, even as it struggles to keep up with increasing restrictions in its own state.

Florida,2022,Q3,"Concern turns to industrial sites and huge farms farther north as the storm heads toward South Carolina.

Florida,2022,Q3,"Such infections are rare. From 2012 to 2021, only 31 cases were reported in the U.S., according to federal data. An infection caused by a brain-eating amoeba killed a child who swam in a Nebraska river over the weekend, health officials said Friday. It was the first such death in the state’s history and the second in the Midwest this summer."
Florida,2022,Q3,"“He’s literally the talk of the hospital because he’s so chunky and so cute,” said George’s mother, Amanda.

Florida,2022,Q3,"Democrats would love to defeat Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in November. But first they must nominate a challenger who can win in a state where they seem to perpetually fall short. HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — On the first day of early voting in Broward County, Florida’s Democratic mecca, Jared Brown, a 41-year-old lawyer who until recently had never attended a Democratic Party meeting, drove to the polls in suburban Hollywood, slipped on a party T-shirt and grabbed a clipboard to go knock on voters’ doors."
Florida,2022,Q3,"At Planned Parenthood and other organizations, she worked behind the scenes for reproductive rights and related causes. Ann McGuiness, a behind-the-scenes force in women’s health and reproductive rights who raised vast amounts of money for Planned Parenthood and other groups and then was a founder of the Contraceptive Access Initiative, which seeks to make hormonal birth control more available over the counter, died on Aug. 3 in Albany, N.Y. She was 65."
Florida,2022,Q3,"The victory by Mr. Crist, a former Republican governor who switched parties, sets up this fall’s contest as a race between a centrist and a hard-right conservative. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Florida Democrats chose Representative Charlie Crist as their nominee for governor on Tuesday, betting that the former Republican governor who campaigned on a return to political decency was their best bet to try to defeat Gov. Ron DeSantis, the polarizing Republican incumbent."
Florida,2022,Q3,"Big Olaf Ice Cream products, which are made in Florida, have sickened people across 10 states, the federal authorities said.

Florida,2022,Q4,"The hurricane’s record-breaking cost will make it even harder for many to get insurance, experts say — threatening home sales, mortgages and construction. The scale of the destruction from Hurricane Ian threatens to destabilize Florida’s insurance and real estate markets, as devastated residents file a record number of claims for damaged or destroyed homes."
Florida,2022,Q4,"Charlie Crist was eager to focus on abortion rights, while Gov. Ron DeSantis often turned his attention to President Biden. Gov. Ron DeSantis and Charlie Crist, his Democratic challenger, debated for the only time in the Florida governor’s race on Monday, a rowdy exchange featuring a raucous crowd and a slew of culture war issues that have dominated the state’s political discourse."

Florida,2022,Q4,"The blockade of my hometown, Nablus, this past October devastated the Palestinian community there in ways that are hard to measure. This year, during the lead-up to the Israeli elections, I returned to my hometown, Nablus, in the occupied West Bank, to work on a research project and spend time with my family there. I had received a grant to study the impact on Palestinians’ health of Israel’s restrictions on Palestinians’ movement — such as checkpoints, travel permits (including those required for medical care), the separation wall spanning the West Bank and road closures."

Florida,2022,Q4,"Older women are more likely to carry fetuses with genetic disorders that often can’t be detected until 15 weeks of pregnancy, beyond the limit set in a Senate proposal. When Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, proposed a national ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, the bill sparked controversy across the political spectrum. But few spoke of its potential impact on the growing number of women who are having children in their 30s."

Florida,2023,Q2,"As he traversed socially conservative Iowa this week, the 2024 contender highlighted his state’s six-week ban. But now, in more moderate New Hampshire, he is shying from the subject. At a stop on his first trip to New Hampshire as a presidential candidate, Gov. Ron DeSantis mentioned his efforts to provide tax relief for Florida families. He mentioned defunding diversity programs at public colleges. He mentioned his fight with Disney."
Florida,2023,Q2,"Gov. Ron DeSantis ushered in a six-week abortion ban and curriculum restrictions, while expanding capital punishment and concealed carry access as he prepared to run for president. Seeking to elevate his stock with his Republican base for his presidential candidacy, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida this year has checked off many boxes on a far-right wish list of laws restricting abortion rights, gender-transition care for minors and teaching about sexual orientation."

Florida,2023,Q2,"Focusing heavily on Florida at his first town-hall event in the Granite State, Ron DeSantis drew a reception that was sometimes warm, sometimes more skeptical — especially on the issue of abortion. At his first town-hall event in New Hampshire, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida talked on Tuesday about illegal immigration in Texas, crime in Chicago, disorder on the streets of San Francisco and the wonders of nearly every aspect of Florida — a state he mentioned about 80 times."

Florida,2023,Q2,"Eating packaged foods like cereal and frozen meals has been associated with anxiety, depression and cognitive decline. Scientists are still piecing together why. Roughly 60 percent of the calories in the average American diet come from highly processed foods. We’ve known for decades that eating such packaged products — like some breakfast cereals, snack bars, frozen meals and virtually all packaged sweets, among many other things — is linked to unwelcome health outcomes, like an increased risk of diabetes, obesity and even cancer. But more recent studies point to another major downside to these often delicious, always convenient foods: They appear to have a significant impact on our minds, too."
Florida,2023,Q2,"The Florida governor is courting the large, politically influential group by pointing to his efforts to lower prescription drug prices. But his pitch can be lost on some voters. As a 44-year-old member of Generation X, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida might be an unlikely candidate to wrest his party’s older voters away from Donald J. Trump, a 76-year-old baby boomer."
Florida,2023,Q3,"Some employers said they were losing workers because of the new law, which was championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. After signing into law a raft of new measures aimed at undocumented immigrants in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the legislation gave the state “the most ambitious anti-illegal immigration laws in the country.”"
Florida,2023,Q3,"We can start by expanding access to care, but we also need to look beyond medicine and address harmful behaviors and poverty. It’s not just that life expectancy in Mississippi (71.9) now appears to be a hair shorter than in Bangladesh (72.4). Nor that an infant is some 70 percent more likely to die in the United States than in other wealthy countries."
Florida,2023,Q3,"Once a vaccine advocate, the Florida governor lost his enthusiasm for the shot before the Delta wave sent Covid hospitalizations and deaths soaring. It’s a grim chapter he now leaves out of his rosy retelling of his pandemic response. On a Saturday in September 2020, with Covid-19 killing more than 600 Americans daily and hundreds of thousands of deaths still to come, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, heard her cellphone ring. It was Dr. Scott Rivkees, the Florida surgeon general. He was distraught."

Florida,2023,Q3,"The loss of support for an AIDS relief program would signal to the rest of the world that it could no longer rely on the U.S. to defend its biggest accomplishments as a leader in global health. At the end of 2001, not long after George W. Bush became president, there were 40 million people across the globe living with H.I.V./AIDS, which was usually a death sentence for those who lacked access to treatment. Most people with H.I.V. lived on the continent of Africa, where 2.3 million died of AIDS that year. There were widespread estimates that 100 million worldwide would die of AIDS in the following 20 years if something wasn’t done to better distribute treatment."
Florida,2023,Q3,"The Kentucky Republican said he would finish his term as leader, which runs through 2024, and in the Senate, where he was elected to serve through 2026.

Florida,2023,Q3,"Medical device makers have bankrolled a cottage industry of doctors and clinics that perform artery-clearing procedures that can lead to amputations.

Florida,2023,Q4,"Xavier Becerra, the health and human services secretary, suggested that states were doing far too little to make sure that children were not unfairly denied federal insurance.

A Florida man and three sons who used a business masquerading as a church to sell more than $1 million of a deadly bleach solution that they claimed was a “miracle” cure for Covid-19 and other diseases were each sentenced on Friday to several years in prison, federal prosecutors in Miami said."
Florida,2023,Q4,"In an overwhelmingly Republican district, Mr. Gaetz is admired for shaking up the House, but he also has plenty of critics. He is polarizing in Washington and polarizing at home. And in both places these days, he is getting more attention than anyone might expect, given his lack of seniority and thin legislative record."
Florida,2023,Q4,"The strike at the truck manufacturer by 4,000 members of the United Automobile Workers comes in the middle of the union’s strikes at three large U.S. car companies.

Florida,2023,Q4,"The senator faced calls to step down as her health declined, amid concerns about the effectiveness of an aging Senate. Over more than a half-century of public life, Senator Dianne Feinstein’s accomplishments rivaled those of anyone in the national arena: The 1994 assault weapons ban. The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on the use of torture. Her trailblazing example as a woman in an overwhelmingly male-dominated political landscape."
Florida,2023,Q4,"A child psychologist, he argued that behavioral therapy had to come first in addressing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, with drugs like Ritalin as a supplement. William E.

He was 75."
Florida,2023,Q4,"Democratic candidates jumped on the story of a woman who left Texas for an abortion as a cautionary tale for voters, and Republicans were largely silent. The case of a Texas woman who sought a court-approved abortion but wound up leaving the state for the procedure is reigniting political arguments that have roiled elections for more than two years, placing Democrats on the offensive and illustrating Republicans’ continued lack of a unified policy response or clear strategy on how to talk about the issue."
Florida,2023,Q4,"Is this really about policy, or is it personal? Donald Trump hasn’t talked much about policy in this election cycle, except for vague assertions that he’ll somehow bring back low unemployment and low inflation — which, by the way, has already happened. (Unemployment has been at or below 4 percent for almost two years. Thursday’s report on consumer spending showed the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of underlying inflation getting close to its 2 percent target.) Most of his energy seems to be devoted to the prospect of wreaking revenge on his political opponents, whom he promises to “root out” like “vermin.”"
Florida,2024,Q1,"The measure would bar networks like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram from giving accounts to children under 16. Florida’s Legislature has passed a sweeping social media bill that would make the state the first to effectively bar young people under 16 from holding accounts on platforms like TikTok and Instagram."
Florida,2024,Q1,"The hacking shut down the nation’s biggest health care payment system, causing financial chaos that affected a broad spectrum ranging from large hospitals to single-doctor practices. An urgent care chain in Ohio may be forced to stop paying rent and other bills to cover salaries. In Florida, a cancer center is racing to find money for chemotherapy drugs to avoid delaying critical treatments for its patients. And in Pennsylvania, a primary care doctor is slashing expenses and pooling all of her cash — including her personal bank stash — in the hopes of staying afloat for the next two months."
Florida,2024,Q1,"There’s a problem with these kinds of government clampdowns. My entire life I’ve seen a similar pattern. Older generations reflect on the deficiencies of “kids these days,” and they find something new to blame. The latest technology and new forms of entertainment are always bewitching our children. In my time, I’ve witnessed several distinct public panics over television, video games and music. They’ve all been overblown."
Florida,2024,Q1,"A record 21 million people signed up for marketplace plans for 2024, drawn in part by more generous federal subsidies. But the expanded subsidies are set to expire after next year. Carley Calvi came to the second floor of a public library in suburban Milwaukee one morning this month without health insurance to cover the vertigo medication she needed. Worse, she said, was not having a doctor she trusted."
Florida,2024,Q1,"Some H.I.V. experts worry that the public health focus on prevention medication has accelerated a decline in condom use. Gay and bisexual men are using condoms less than ever, and the decline has been particularly steep among those who are young or Hispanic, according to a new study. The worrisome trend points to an urgent need for better prevention strategies as the nation struggles to beat the H.I.V. epidemic, researchers said."
Florida,2024,Q1,"A new Florida law also requires apps like TikTok and Snapchat to obtain a parent’s consent before giving accounts to 14- and 15-year-olds. Florida on Monday became the first state to effectively bar residents under the age of 14 from holding accounts on services like TikTok and Instagram, enacting a strict social media bill that is likely to upend the lives of many young people."
Florida,2024,Q1,"Hunching over a device can mess with your gait, slow you down and poison your mood. And that’s before you trip and fall. Spend time on any crowded sidewalk and you’ll see heads bent over and eyes cast downward.

Florida,2024,Q1,"Tianeptine, found at convenience stores, at smoke shops and online, can mimic an opioid. It is among a growing class of substances that are difficult to control. The young father headed across the parking lot to join the other parents meeting their children’s new preschool teachers. After a few steps, he began sweating and twitching. As the sky reeled, he staggered back to the car, desperate to lie down in the back seat and breathe, hidden by tinted windows."
Florida,2024,Q1,"The agency authorized Florida to purchase medicines directly from wholesalers in Canada, where prices are far cheaper. Pharmaceutical companies oppose the plan. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed Florida to import millions of dollars worth of medications from Canada at far lower prices than in the United States, overriding fierce decades-long objections from the pharmaceutical industry."
Florida,2024,Q1,"The Queen Victoria was on its way to Honolulu from San Francisco on a 107-night world cruise when more than 150 people on board reported symptoms, officials said.

Florida,2024,Q2,"The 51 locations, next to Supercenters, proved too costly to be profitable, the retailer said. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, said Tuesday that it was shutting down its health care centers, a network that only last year it said it planned to expand."
Florida,2024,Q2,"The law also stops programs designed to encourage renewable energy and conservation in a state that is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Florida’s state government will no longer be required to consider climate change when crafting energy policy under legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican."
Florida,2024,Q2,"The president’s campaign moved to pin responsibility squarely on Donald Trump after the Florida Supreme Court cleared the way for a six-week ban. President Biden on Tuesday called a decision by the Florida Supreme Court to uphold a restrictive abortion law “outrageous” and “extreme,” saying that it had effectively eliminated access to the procedure across the American South."
Florida,2024,Q2,"The vice president sought to tie former President Donald J. Trump to the state’s six-week abortion ban, which took effect on Wednesday. On the day that Florida began to enforce its six-week abortion ban, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a searing attack on former President Donald J. Trump in Jacksonville, calling the measure “another Trump abortion ban” and saying he was forcing women to live a “horrific reality” without access to essential medical care."
Florida,2024,Q2,"The Biden campaign has made abortion one of its top issues, as polling shows it is one of the few subjects in which voters place more trust in President Biden than Donald Trump. President Biden on Tuesday strongly condemned a six-week abortion ban that will soon take effect in Florida, saying it would force women to endure “unbearable pain and cruelty” and blaming former President Donald J.

Florida,2024,Q3,"When ‘states’ rights’ means subverting the will of the people. Florida Republicans couldn’t keep an abortion amendment off the ballot — they lost that fight in the State Supreme Court in April. So Gov. Ron DeSantis is using other means to dissuade people from voting yes on Amendment 4, which would allow abortion until fetal viability (typically around 24 weeks). The state’s current law, passed by the Florida Legislature in April 2023, bans abortion after six weeks, which is before many women even know they’re pregnant."

Florida,2024,Q4,"The state has taken steps to shore up its insurance market, but researchers warn of looming risks. Hurricane Milton would have done more damage if it had made landfall a few dozen miles farther north. The southern side of the hurricane, with its Category 3 winds spiraling counterclockwise, would have driven a wall of seawater into downtown Tampa.
