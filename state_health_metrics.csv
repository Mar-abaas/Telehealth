The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type.

This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid. For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm). For 2023 and historical thresholds, use [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html)."

"Notes"
"The American Community Survey did not release the 1-year estimates for 2020 due to significant disruptions to data collection brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by KFF. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.    In this analysis, income (mostly categorized as a percent of the federal poverty level) is aggregated by Census-defined family units. Analyzing income by family unit captures income available to a group of people who are likely sharing resources. However, family units may not be the appropriate measure for capturing eligibility for health insurance. Eligibility for health insurance is more accurately estimated using ""health insurance units,"" which may be counted differently for different types of insurance (such as Medicaid or employer coverage). The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type. Data may not sum to totals due to rounding. Data include the civilian noninstitutionalized population in the United States."

"Notes"
"Data are reported for each calendar month. Monthly enrollment data may be updated in subsequent CMS Eligibility and Enrollment Reports. For data from June 2017 to present, several states have revised their methodology to better align with CMS Eligibility and Enrollment Reports criteria; data reported for May 2017 and earlier months were not updated to reflect this change in methodology and may not be comparable to enrollment from June 2017 forward.  The total increase in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment between the Pre-ACA Average Monthly Medicaid/CHIP Enrollment and each month reported post-ACA implementation include data only from states reporting for both periods. For more information, please see [CMS, Medicaid and CHIP Applications, Eligibility Determinations, and Enrollment Data](http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/medicaid-and-chip-application-eligibility-determination-and-enrollment-data.html).

"Definitions"
"*Pre-ACA Average Monthly Medicaid/CHIP Enrollment:* The average number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP for each month during the July-September, 2013 period using an average of enrollment numbers submitted by the states for each month in this period. Not all states submitted three months of data; the average is calculated using any months of baseline data that were provided. The unit of measurement is individuals enrolled as of the last day of the reporting period (month). *Post-ACA Medicaid/CHIP Monthly Enrollment:* The total unduplicated number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP as of the last day of each reporting period, including those with retroactive, conditional, and presumptive eligibility. This indicator is a point-in-time count of total program enrollment and is not solely a count of those newly enrolled during the reporting period. This number includes only those individuals who are eligible for comprehensive benefits (e.g., emergency Medicaid, family planning-only coverage and limited benefit dual eligible individuals are excluded). Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration populations are included as long as the benefits and networks are comprehensive. CHIP children subject to a waiting period or premium lock-out period are considered eligible but not enrolled and are not included. Data are subject to change based on subsequent CMS enrollment reports. Other reporting on Medicaid and CHIP enrollment by states and researchers may include some beneficiaries excluded in these data (because comprehensive coverage is not provided), or may use a different methodology. *Percent Change:* The percentage change in total post-ACA Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, from the pre-ACA average monthly Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment (July-Sept 2013) to each monthly enrollment total reported (as described above). Percent change is calculated for each month as compared to the baseline data. Changes in enrollment levels are driven by the number of newly enrolled individuals as well as by the number of individuals whose coverage has terminated. *N/A*: Data not available. Please see full [CMS reports](http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/medicaid-and-chip-application-eligibility-determination-and-enrollment-data.html) for state-specific footnotes and caveats."

"Private: Poverty Rate by Metropolitan Status"
"Notes"
"Non-Metropolitan includes both respondents living in non-metropolitan areas and areas not classified in either category. In this analysis, income (mostly categorized as a percent of the federal poverty level) is aggregated by Census-defined family units. Analyzing income by family unit captures income available to a group of people who are likely sharing resources. However, family units may not be the appropriate measure for capturing eligibility for health insurance.  Eligibility for health insurance is more accurately estimated using ""health insurance units,"" which may be counted differently for different types of insurance (such as Medicaid or employer coverage). The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $20,160 in 2016.  This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid.  For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm).  Data may not sum to totals due to rounding."

"Notes"
"The unemployment rate measures unemployment within the civilian non-institutional population aged 16 years and older. Data refer to place of residence. Data for Puerto Rico are derived from a monthly household survey similar to the Current Population Survey. Area definitions are based on Office of Management and Budget Bulletin No. 15-01, dated July 15, 2015, and are available on the BLS website at [http://www.bls.gov/lau/lausmsa.htm](http://www.bls.gov/lau/lausmsa.htm). Numerical data are rounded to the nearest thousand. State numerical data may not sum to the national total due to rounding.
