GREENBELT, Md. — Last month, the owner of a small pharmacy here secured two dozen courses of Pfizer’s new medication for treating Covid-19, eager to quickly provide them to his high-risk customers who test positive for the virus."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"The virus “is not known to linger in the air,” agency officials said. But the research is far from definitive. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday pushed back against the idea that the monkeypox virus can spread through the air, saying the virus is usually transmitted through direct physical contact with sores or contaminated materials from a patient."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"But prior infection does not guarantee protection from the virus, officials said, and Americans should still get vaccinated and boosted. Sixty percent of Americans, including 75 percent of children, had been infected with the coronavirus by February, federal health officials reported on Tuesday — another remarkable milestone in a pandemic that continues to confound expectations."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"Buildings need to disinfect the air. At every stage of the pandemic, a disproportionate number of coronavirus infections have been traced to a relatively small number of gatherings, also known as superspreader events. The recent Gridiron dinner, after which over 70 people tested positive, including members of the Biden administration, is just the latest example."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"Nationwide, the number of kindergartners with the required shots fell below the target for broad immunity, raising fears of outbreaks of measles and other illnesses. Kindergartners in the United States fell behind on routine childhood vaccinations during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday, a slide that experts attributed to skipped checkups and to a groundswell of resistance to Covid-19 shots spilling into unease about other vaccines."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"Many parents have greeted the news that young children can soon be vaccinated against Covid with a sigh of relief. Others have deep reservations. For many parents across the United States, the long-awaited news that young children would soon become eligible for a coronavirus vaccine was met with a rush of relief."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"The move in a religion case offers hope to those worried about the dominance of the court’s conservative majority. What a week so far for conservatives. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court struck down a Maine law that prohibited religious private schools from receiving taxpayer dollars. On Thursday, it invalidated a New York State gun safety law limiting the public carry of firearms. And on Friday, it overturned Roe v. Wade. The outcome in these cases was not surprising. The court has ruled in favor of religious litigants in an overwhelming number of cases; the gun case’s outcome was clear from the oral argument before the justices in November; and the court’s draft abortion decision was leaked in May."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"Experts say that grief over a death affects a wide range of people, beyond those who might be mentioned in an obituary. They add up to more than 1 million people."

Maryland,2022.0,Q3,The vaccine has not yet been authorized but is expected to be soon. The Biden administration announced on Monday that it would buy 3.2 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine from the Maryland pharmaceutical company Novavax that is expected to soon receive authorization in the United States.
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"The student loan plan is the latest example of Democrats practicing the art of the possible on the nation’s most pressing economic challenges and ending up with risky or patchwork solutions. WASHINGTON — President Biden’s move this week to cancel student loan debt for tens of millions of borrowers and reduce future loan payments for millions more comes with a huge catch, economists warn: It does almost nothing to limit the skyrocketing cost of college and could very well fuel even faster tuition increases in the future."
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"Freeman Hrabowski transformed a onetime commuter school into the country’s strongest pipeline of Black graduates in science, technology, engineering and math. BALTIMORE — Late one night in the fall of 2020, when Kizzmekia Corbett learned the vaccine she had helped design was highly effective against the coronavirus, there was only one person she wanted to call: Freeman A. Hrabowski III, the longtime president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,Russia used a formal meeting in Geneva to air its unsupported accusations but faced considerable diplomatic pushback. The State Department strongly criticized Russia on Tuesday for making what it called “spurious allegations” that the United States operated clandestine biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine.
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"Democrats in Congress are under pressure to act after the Supreme Court’s decision. But with Republicans and at least one Democrat opposed in the Senate, the measures are all but certain to fail. WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress, under pressure to take quick action in response to the Supreme Court’s decision striking down abortion rights, are planning to hold votes this week on legislation that seeks to preserve access to abortions in the post-Roe v. Wade era."
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"Experts say the U.S. government has unintentionally encouraged a dependency on imported masks by failing to promote elastomeric respirators, a reusable mask that is domestically produced. In the early 1990s, long before P.P.E., N95 and asymptomatic transmission became household terms, federal health officials issued guidelines for how medical workers should protect themselves from tuberculosis during a resurgence of the highly infectious respiratory disease."
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"The shots from Novavax are only for people who have not yet been vaccinated, which is likely to limit their uptake at first. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Tuesday that a newly authorized vaccine from Novavax be used as an option for adults seeking a primary immunization against the coronavirus."
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"In the aftermath of the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, there has been a flurry of activity in the states as officials move to prohibit or expand abortion access.

Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"Everyone knows that weight lifting increases physical strength. But, for some, it can give psychological power, too. When Cheng Xu was serving in the Canadian Armed Forces as a paratrooper and infantry officer, he experienced a series of traumatic events in rapid succession — his best friend and fellow officer took his own life, a soldier under his command was injured during a live fire exercise and a close friend’s father was kidnapped."

Maryland,2022.0,Q4,"Democrats showed up, Trump-backed candidates underperformed and inflation wasn’t the whole story: Here are last night’s lessons. Democrats tried to outrun history — and the lead weight of a wounded president who made his final political appearance of the campaign in deep-blue Maryland, in a county he won two years ago by an overwhelming margin."
Maryland,2022.0,Q4,"Most patients manage dissociative identity disorder, according to experts, rather than cure it. Herschel Walker, the G.O.P. Senate candidate in Georgia, says he has “overcome” his illness. WASHINGTON — Confronting a barrage of accusations about his personal life — including claims he threatened women and paid for an abortion despite his public opposition to the procedure — Herschel Walker has repeatedly invoked his history of mental illness in his defense."
Maryland,2022.0,Q4,"The bill, which passed the Senate on Thursday, now heads to President Biden’s desk for his signature. WASHINGTON — Congress on Friday cleared a roughly $1.7 trillion government funding package that would provide significant increases to national security and domestic spending and billions of dollars to aid Ukraine, sending the measure to President Biden’s desk for his signature."
Maryland,2022.0,Q4,"The leak of a draft opinion, he said, “gave people a rational reason to think” the eventual decision could be prevented “by killing one of us.” WASHINGTON — The leak of his draft majority opinion overruling Roe v. Wade put the Supreme Court justices in the majority at risk of assassination, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said during wide-ranging remarks in a public interview on Tuesday at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative legal group."
Maryland,2022.0,Q4,"The report, an annual tradition, shed no light on the investigation into the leak of a draft opinion in May or on calls for more rigorous ethics rules for the justices. WASHINGTON — At the end of a wrenching year at the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. devoted his annual report on the state of the federal judiciary to threats to judges’ physical safety."
Maryland,2022.0,Q4,"A hugely ambitious show, the 58th Carnegie International in Pittsburgh, leaves our critic wondering just who, or what, art exhibitions like this are for. PITTSBURGH — I spent two days at the Carnegie International, at the Carnegie Museum of Art, and it was hardly enough. The 58th edition of North America’s longest-running international art show is a deluge of art and information that left me with an urgent, unsettled question: Who, or what, are shows like this for?"

The company that makes a majority of the abortion pill mifepristone sold in the United States sued the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday, a new legal volley in a string of recent court maneuverings over the fate of the drug."
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"Regardless of income or education, Black mothers have worse birth outcomes. When Afrika Gupton-Jones was on bed rest in the hospital, after developing high blood pressure at 28 weeks of pregnancy, her husband was with her day and night. Yet the nurses often assumed that he was her brother, and that she was a single mother. When the doctors and nurses gave her medications or took her blood, she said, they gave her minimal explanation."
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"Nearly 6 percent of American teens and adults have cannabis use disorder. Smoking weed had always been a social activity for Julian. He first tried cannabis in high school, and as an adult he would smoke a couple of times a month with friends. But things changed after he moved to a new city where he didn’t know anyone. Julian (who asked not to use his last name when talking about a sensitive medical condition) didn’t have much of a social life, so he started smoking by himself to pass the time. “Weed became my friend,” he said. “I would get off work and I would smoke because I was bored.”"
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"The monthslong absence of the California Democrat, 89, who was hospitalized for shingles in February, threatened to deprive her party of the votes to advance President Biden’s judicial nominees. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, was returning to Washington on Tuesday evening, her office announced, after a nearly three-month absence from the Senate that threatened to deprive her party of the ability to advance President Biden’s judicial nominees and grind its agenda to a halt in the closely divided chamber."
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"Three laws tighten restrictions on gun purchases and possession. A fourth law rolls back protections for gun manufacturers and sellers, making it easier for victims of gun violence to sue. Gov.

Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"Smoke driven by the wildfires in Canada lingered over the Northeast and Midwest on Friday. Conditions were expected to improve over the Fourth of July weekend. Air quality remained poor in the Northeast on Friday, but conditions were improving across much of the Midwest as rain and winds from the west and south began to disperse wildfire smoke from Canada that had hung over much of the country this week."
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"Lab safety doesn’t need to torpedo scientific progress. The 2007 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain was traced to a faulty drainage pipe at a research facility. In 2015 the Department of Defense discovered that a germ-warfare program in Utah had mistakenly mailed almost 200 samples of live anthrax over 12 years. In 2018 a burst pipe released as many as 3,000 gallons of wastewater from labs working with Ebola and anthrax at Fort Detrick in Maryland onto a grassy area a few feet from an open storm drain."
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"The corporatization of health care has changed the practice of medicine, causing many physicians to feel alienated from their work. Some years ago, a psychiatrist named Wendy Dean read an article about a physician who died by suicide. Such deaths were distressingly common, she discovered. The suicide rate among doctors appeared to be even higher than the rate among active military members, a notion that startled Dean, who was then working as an administrator at a U.S. Army medical research center in Maryland. Dean started asking the physicians she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of them confided that they were struggling. Some complained that they didn’t have enough time to talk to their patients because they were too busy filling out electronic medical records. Others bemoaned having to fight with insurers about whether a person with a serious illness would be preapproved for medication. The doctors Dean surveyed were deeply committed to the medical profession. But many of them were frustrated and unhappy, she sensed, not because they were burned out from working too hard but because the health care system made it so difficult to care for their patients."

Maryland,2023.0,Q3,"Congress has long been an institution that runs on seniority and rewards longevity, and these veteran lawmakers are still running the country at an age when most people are well into retirement.

Maryland,2023.0,Q3,"John Angelos wants to reimagine the way Baltimore approaches the business of baseball, but his team’s electric young core may not be around to see the result. It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, which is always how it should be at Oriole Park, in the shadow of the B&O Warehouse at Camden Yards. This is the setting, after all, that transformed professional sports as few other forces ever have, synergizing team and town and making the venue the star attraction."
Maryland,2023.0,Q3,"A decades-old program created by President George W. Bush to combat AIDS around the world is at risk of being sucked into a partisan dispute over abortion, with some Republicans threatening to block its renewal. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former House speaker, and George W. Bush, the Republican former president, do not agree on much. But earlier this year, they joined a high-powered gathering in Washington — with the Irish rock star Bono on video from Dublin — to mark the 20th anniversary of America’s biggest and, arguably, most successful foreign aid program."
Maryland,2023.0,Q3,"Dr. Brian P.

Maryland,2023.0,Q4,"Doctors say the diabetes medication, and drugs like it, could counteract the weight patients gain on antipsychotics and antidepressants. It was Joanna Acevedo’s psychiatrist who first raised the idea of a weight-loss drug. Since 2018, Ms. Acevedo has relied on antipsychotic medications to manage her bipolar disorder. The drugs kept her paranoia at bay — really, they kept her alive, she said. They also led her to gain 70 pounds. By age 26, she had become prediabetic."
Maryland,2023.0,Q4,"The pandemic and recent wildfires have shown how unhealthy indoor air can be. But scientific and governmental inertia have slowed the necessary remedies. In early 2020, the world scrubbed down surfaces, washed hands and sneezed into elbows, desperate to avoid infection with a new coronavirus. But the threat was not really lying on countertops and doorknobs."
Maryland,2023.0,Q4,"Dry conditions and high salt levels in the water allowed for halobacteria to thrive, turning a pond bubble-gum pink.

Maryland,2023.0,Q4,"The United States has no coherent system for providing long-term care, leading many who are aging to struggle to stay independent or to rely on a patchwork of solutions. Margaret Newcomb, 69, a retired French teacher, is desperately trying to protect her retirement savings by caring for her 82-year-old husband, who has severe dementia, at home in Seattle. She used to fear his disease-induced paranoia, but now he’s so frail and confused that he wanders away with no idea of how to find his way home. He gets lost so often that she attaches a tag to his shoelace with her phone number."

Maybe it was an intense spin class that put you over the edge, or reaching for a personal best in the squat. Perhaps it was dancing all night at a wedding reception, using muscles you haven’t worked in years. Whatever the cause, the next day you’re stiff, sore and moving a little slowly."

Maryland,2024.0,Q1,"Jason Palmer, an entrepreneur from Maryland, was denied a win over President Biden due to a rounding error. He did secure three of the territory’s six delegates. It looked at first like an embarrassing loss for a president struggling to rally his party behind him: For three hours on Tuesday night, President Biden appeared to have lost the Democratic caucus on a faraway Pacific island, American Samoa, to a little-known opponent."
Maryland,2024.0,Q1,"There are several factors driving the spread of the highly infectious virus, experts said.

Standing over a tiny bundle wrapped in a sheet on a hospital bed, a young father drapes his hand across his face in despair. Mousa Salem, a Gaza photographer who videotaped this sad tableau and sent it to me, said the sheet swaddled 2-month-old Mohamed al-Zayegh, who died on Friday in Kamal Adwan Hospital in Gaza City. “Nutrition?

Maryland,2024.0,Q1,"The bipartisan bill emerged one day before the federal funding deadline, and it was not clear whether Congress could complete it in time to avoid a partial shutdown after midnight on Friday.

Maryland,2024.0,Q1,"Progress’s challenge: Our problems shape-shift in response to our solutions, which then become problems themselves. In 2008, Alan Graham brought an idea to a neighborhood meeting in Austin, Texas: he wanted to build a mobile home park in the neighborhood for people coming out of chronic homelessness. He already had a plot of land, given to him by the city. But residents hated the idea. They voted against it, 52 to 0. So he shelved it for years until he could reimagine it on the outskirts of the city."
Maryland,2024.0,Q1,"After hours of delay, the Senate overwhelmingly voted for the $1.2 trillion bill to fund more than half of the government, sending the measure to President Biden’s desk. The Senate overwhelmingly gave final approval early Saturday to a $1.2 trillion spending bill to fund more than half of the government, effectively averting a shutdown by sending the legislation to President Biden’s desk just hours after a midnight deadline."
Maryland,2024.0,Q2,"Tens of millions of farm animals cross state lines every year, traveling in cramped, stressful conditions that can facilitate the spread of disease. The bird flu virus that is spreading through American dairy cows can probably be traced back to a single spillover event. Late last year, scientists believe, the virus jumped from wild birds into cattle in the Texas panhandle. By this spring, the virus, known as H5N1, had traveled hundreds of miles or more, appearing on farms in Idaho, North Carolina and Michigan."
Maryland,2024.0,Q2,"Several G.O.P. Senate candidates used to embrace anti-abortion views. Now they are shifting their positions on an issue that has become an electoral liability for their party.

The heat index — a measure of how the temperature feels — hit 102 degrees in Cincinnati."
Maryland,2024.0,Q2,"Age and health have drawn intensive focus in the presidential race, but the recent news that two octogenarians in the Senate are running again has prompted little discussion of their age. While President Biden tries to assuage voter concerns about his age in a presidential race that includes the two oldest men ever to seek the White House, a couple of miles away in the U.S. Senate, the gerontocracy remains alive and well — and little commented upon."
Maryland,2024.0,Q2,"A few “reasonable precautions” can help people keep their pets safe from the H5N1 virus, experts say. Over the past few months, a bird flu outbreak has spread swiftly through dairy cows in the United States, infecting more than 90 herds in 12 states. Along the way, the virus has caused collateral damage in several other species, spreading from dairies to poultry farms and from cows into at least three farm workers, who developed symptoms of mild illness."
Maryland,2024.0,Q2,"Many are dying from fentanyl and other drugs. The hardest-hit are Black men in their 50s to 70s, a group that Baltimore’s changing economy left behind.

Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"Public health experts fear that the highly contagious variant cannot be stopped without harsh measures that the public will no longer tolerate. Even as President Biden on Tuesday outlined new plans for battling the highly contagious Omicron variant, public health experts warned that the measures would not be sufficient to prevent a grim rise in infections and hospitalizations over the next few weeks."
Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"A federal plan to require health insurers to cover the cost of at-home tests is not yet in effect. But there are other options. Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced that it would soon require private health insurers to reimburse consumers for the cost of at-home coronavirus tests. It was a step toward improving access to the tests, which remain more expensive in the United States than in Europe, where they are often distributed for little or no cost."
Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"The states were examining whether the actions of Facebook, now called Meta, violated state consumer protection laws and put the public at risk.

Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"The contagious new variant has companies and government officials wondering whether Americans can really be considered vaccinated without booster shots.

Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"People with markers for cancer often need more screenings. But health insurers are not required to fully cover them.  Tens of millions of Americans have received genetic tests illuminating their risk of disease, and a majority of adults in the United States say they would be interested in getting tested. When we each turned 20, we sought genetic testing to learn whether we had inherited our mother’s BRCA mutation, which significantly increases the risk of breast, ovarian and other cancers. We each had a 50 percent chance of inheriting it, but our fates diverged: One of us, Emma, has the mutation, and the other, Leah, does not."
Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"Hoping to prevent further disruptions to daily life, the C.D.C. reduced the period that certain infected Americans must sequester. As daily coronavirus cases in the United States soared to near record levels, federal health officials on Monday shortened by half the recommended isolation period for many infected Americans, hoping to minimize rising disruptions to the economy and everyday life."
Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"Methods to get people vaccinated without requiring them to change their beliefs are promising. At this point in the pandemic, many Americans remain unvaccinated because they believe the coronavirus vaccine is unlikely to do them any good. They’re aware of the virus and the damage it can cause, but for any number of reasons, they simply don’t believe they should get a vaccine. We’ve spoken to patients like this in our practice, and we have observed in those conversations that providing more, frightening information intended to change their beliefs is ineffective for many or may even cause further entrenchment against vaccination."
Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"The agency has taken a controversial stand on vaping as a way to quit tobacco. This is what the research shows. When they first appeared in the United States in the mid-2000s, “electronic nicotine delivery systems” — e-cigarettes, vapes, e-liquids and other wares that contain the stimulant found in tobacco — were subject to little federal oversight. Their makers could incorporate countless other ingredients and flavorings. Like cigarettes before them, the devices proved extremely attractive to young people; in 2018, the surgeon general declared youth vaping an “epidemic” and noted that one in five high schoolers and one in 20 middle schoolers used e-cigarettes. Nicotine can harm the developing brain, and e-cigarettes contain potentially harmful toxins like heavy metals; the long-term effects of vaping — the heating of nicotine to create an inhaled aerosol — are uncertain."
Massachusetts,2022.0,Q1,"Future surges will be less likely to make us seriously ill. Omicron is really good at infecting people and doing it fast. So fast, in fact, that by the time you read this, chances are that cases have already reached a peak in your neighborhood."

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q2,"Several states have already taken steps to protect abortion rights, and many are taking additional measures in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling.

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q3,"The most urgent step the federal government can take is to ensure access to medication abortion. Barely two weeks have passed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and already chaos reigns. Several states are moving to ban abortion almost completely, abortion-rights proponents are challenging those bans in court and in some cases, judges have been asked to issue injunctions that could, for a time, prevent the bans from going into effect."
Massachusetts,2022.0,Q3,"The former mayor will serve as a visiting fellow at institutes focused on health and politics at the university this fall.

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q3,"As people age, they get less satisfaction from travel, cars, clothes and appliances. If the recent rout in the stock market has you drastically cutting back your retirement spending plans, it probably means that you were counting too much on ever-rising asset prices. But a new research paper suggests that spending less at advanced ages is not necessarily a sign of failure to plan. Even people who plan perfectly do it."
Massachusetts,2022.0,Q4,"On Tuesday, the state’s voters overwhelmingly supported letting a two-year-old law take effect. The company’s lawsuit is viewed by anti-smoking advocates as a tactic that could keep menthol cigarettes on the market longer. R.J.

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q4,"Doctors and midwives in blue states are working to get abortion pills into red states — setting the stage for a historic legal clash. When Linda Prine learned she was pregnant in 1970, she was a first-year college student in Wisconsin, where abortion was largely illegal. The doctor who gave her the news saw the look on Prine’s face and handed her a slip of paper with a phone number. Prine waited until other students in her dorm left for class to call from a phone in the hallway. The woman she spoke to gave her the names of psychiatrists and told her to persuade them that she would be suicidal if she were to have a baby. Prine followed the instructions and was able to get an appointment for an abortion at the university hospital. "

Scans of his brain even revealed severe atrophying and the hallmarks of the disease: rough, hard, amyloid plaques and spaghetti-like tangles of tau proteins. But the fatal brain disease did not appear until the man was 67."

The kits, which were often lethargic and wandering by themselves, also seemed unusually easy to approach, showing little fear of humans."

Michigan,2022.0,Q4,"Dr. James Heaps faces up to 21 years in prison after he was convicted of five criminal counts, prosecutors said.

Michigan,2022.0,Q4,"The overturning of Roe v. Wade got people to the polls. Democrats must learn from that. Support for abortion rights appears to have been a major factor in the midterm elections, helping Democrats fare much better than expected in many places. Though Republicans seized control of the House, dashing hopes of federal legislation to codify Roe v. Wade in the next two years, the midterm results suggest that running on abortion can be a winning strategy for Democrats. The outcome offers lessons to Democrats looking ahead to a 2024 presidential election that could determine if a federal abortion ban is on the table."
Michigan,2022.0,Q4,"Shock and outrage over the fall of Roe v. Wade has faded as confusion has spread, deflating Democrats’ hopes that the issue could carry them to victory.

Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"Fixing the background check system can be done today, but it will take work. A litany of exasperating rituals flows from America’s regular mass shootings. One of the most frustrating is the hand-wringing that our politics is so polarized that there’s no way to move forward."

Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"Wegovy and other drugs expose a social tension between a quest to medicate illness and a stigmatizing belief that obese people lack sufficient willpower to lose weight. Eileen Isotalo was always able to lose weight, but always gained it back. Now 66, her first diet was with Weight Watchers at age 14.

As Americans digested a Texas judge’s ruling on Friday night invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone — and a contradictory ruling from a Washington State judge ordering the F.D.A. to maintain its approval as is in some states — the divide in political reactions was as much between words and silence as it was between pro- and anti-abortion rights."

Michigan,2023.0,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated. In the wake of the decision, 15 largely conservative states imposed near-total bans (through trigger laws or new legislation), and two more set limits at six weeks of pregnancy. "

Michigan,2023.0,Q4,"While a narrative emerged that the pandemic indiscriminately struck the young and healthy, new evidence suggests that frail young adults were most vulnerable. The flu typically kills the very young, the old and the sick. That made the virus in 1918 unusual, or so the story goes: It killed healthy young people as readily as those who were frail or had chronic conditions."

Michigan,2024.0,Q1,"The father missed cries for help and failed to secure the gun his son used in a deadly rampage in a Michigan high school, prosecutors said. The defense said he “did not know what his son was planning.” Prosecutors in Michigan on Thursday accused James Crumbley of failing to secure the gun that his son used to open fire in a high school hallway and kill four students — one of several ways they say he could have stopped the deadliest school shooting in state history."
Michigan,2024.0,Q1,"Witness testimony and closing arguments ended on Wednesday. Mr. Crumbley faces involuntary manslaughter charges for the four students killed by his son.

Michigan,2024.0,Q1,"Gretchen Whitmer knows that abortion could decide the presidential race. At a Detroit union hall in mid-February, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan gathered representatives from local carpenters and construction unions, along with participants in an apprenticeship program, for a round-table event to draw attention to the ways the Biden administration has helped organized labor. At every seat around the U-shaped table, there was a flier from Whitmer’s Fight Like Hell PAC, but it didn’t address jobs; it was about abortion."
Michigan,2024.0,Q1,"On economics, Donald Trump is just Mitch McConnell with tariffs. There was a lot of breathless speculation before Tuesday’s presidential primaries in Michigan, but the actual results didn’t clarify the two most important questions: How many “uncommitted” voters angry about President Biden’s approach to the war in Gaza will abstain in November, even though Donald Trump would surely be much more supportive of Benjamin Netanyahu than Biden? And how many blue-collar workers will support Trump in the false belief that he’s on their side?"

Michigan,2024.0,Q2,"The deal, which could be announced in coming weeks, would bring an end to one of the last major cases stemming from a horrific sports scandal.

These infections represent the first time that a highly pathogenic bird flu virus, which is often fatal in birds, has been detected in U.S. cattle."
Michigan,2024.0,Q2,"The governor of Michigan isn’t saying it should be her, but she’s not saying it shouldn’t be, either. Whatever the result of this year’s election, it will most likely be the end of an era. Because of their ages — not to mention the law for whoever wins — it’s hard to imagine President Biden or former President Donald Trump running again in 2028, opening the door to a new generation of political leaders. And for Democrats, there are few politicians talked about more than Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan."
Michigan,2024.0,Q2,"A new poll of female voters finds that concerns about inflation are still paramount, even as abortion could motivate Democratic women in states where the issue is on the ballot. Almost every path to victory for President Biden relies on strong support from women. But his current standing among women is the weakest lead a Democrat has had since 2004, a key factor in how tight the race is."
Michigan,2024.0,Q2,"Several G.O.P. Senate candidates used to embrace anti-abortion views. Now they are shifting their positions on an issue that has become an electoral liability for their party.

Michigan,2024.0,Q3,"The next fights over health care won’t be legislative brawls or executive actions — they will be a deluge of battles in the courts. After maintaining an oddly low profile early in the election season, health care is a wallflower no more. Last week, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, suggested a second Trump administration might roll back the protections under the Affordable Care Act ensuring that patients with pre-existing conditions are covered. Perhaps he was trying to formulate some “concepts of a plan” that days earlier former President Donald Trump offered during the presidential debate when asked what he had in mind for supplanting the health care law."

Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"The key findings in the report echo complaints that some Minneapolis residents have made for years. The report could lead to a court-enforced consent decree. The Justice Department accused the Minneapolis Police Department of rampant discrimination, unlawful conduct and systemic mismanagement in a scathing 89-page report released on Friday."

Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"Some are taking sick days. Others are cutting back their hours. Still others end up quitting altogether. Menopause costs American women an estimated $1.8 billion in lost working time per year, according to a Mayo Clinic study published this week. The paper examined how hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and the myriad other symptoms associated with this time of life affect women in the workplace. It’s the largest study of its kind to have been done in the United States."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"If work for companies like Uber and Lyft once carried some appeal for offering flexibility, the kind of labor it has come to represent is now used by some as shorthand for a raw deal. When more than 11,000 film and television writers in the Writers Guild of America union went on strike this month, they called out deteriorating working conditions, criticized unfair pay and said they worried about losing their jobs to artificial intelligence."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"A lifelong protester, he became a leading promoter of organic food and a forceful critic of a food industry that genetically engineers what it produces and sells. Ronnie Cummins, a ponytailed activist who became one of the country’s leading advocates for organic food and a leading critic of genetically modified food, died on April 26 in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where he lived and worked part-time. He was 76."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"The city said it would try to negotiate a court-enforced consent decree with the federal government that would require an overhaul of its police force. The Justice Department said on Friday that the Minneapolis police routinely discriminated against Black and Native American people, used deadly force without justification and trampled the First Amendment rights of protesters and journalists — damning findings that grew out of a multiyear investigation and may lead to a court-enforced overhaul. "
Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"The United States’ struggle to respond to the virus has highlighted the importance of communicating with the public, sharing data and stockpiling vital supplies.

Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"Madera Community Hospital in the Central Valley of California shuttered early this year, upending access to health care in the region. Driving along Highway 99, the Central Valley artery that runs alongside freight train tracks and groves of now-blossoming almond trees, it’s difficult to miss the skeleton of Madera Community Hospital."

Minnesota,2023.0,Q2,"Smoke driven by the wildfires in Canada lingered over the Northeast and Midwest on Friday. Conditions were expected to improve over the Fourth of July weekend. Air quality remained poor in the Northeast on Friday, but conditions were improving across much of the Midwest as rain and winds from the west and south began to disperse wildfire smoke from Canada that had hung over much of the country this week."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"Human research trials at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia have been paused while regulators review whether protocols were violated. Federal regulators have suspended research on human subjects at the Columbia-affiliated New York State Psychiatric Institute, one of the country’s oldest research centers, as they investigate safety protocols across the institute after the suicide of a research participant."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"So far, 24 states have eliminated sales taxes on period products that have been criticized as discriminatory. On Friday, a bipartisan Texas bill that eliminates sales taxes on menstrual products went into effect, making it the 24th state in the country, as well as District of Columbia, to remove what is colloquially known as the “tampon tax.”"
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"The nation uses an enormous number of animals for commercial purposes, and regulations do not adequately protect against outbreaks, experts concluded. The United States is home to an enormous array of animal industries — including industrial agriculture, fur farming and the exotic pet trade — that pose a significant risk of creating infectious disease outbreaks in humans, according to a new report by experts at Harvard Law School and New York University. Moreover, the nation “has no comprehensive strategy” to mitigate the dangers posed by these practices, many of which operate with little regulation and out of public view, the authors concluded."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"The woman had sought medical help for over an hour before giving birth, officials said. The episode, which has drawn criticism, highlights issues about the incarceration of pregnant women. A woman gave birth alone in a jail cell in Tennessee on Tuesday after seeking medical attention for more than an hour, the authorities said, raising questions about the care provided to the woman and her baby."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"Some doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are fleeing restrictive abortion laws. Idaho has been particularly hard hit. One by one, doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are disappearing from Idaho — part of a wave of obstetricians fleeing restrictive abortion laws and a hostile state legislature. Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, a family doctor who also delivers babies in the tiny mountain town of McCall, is among those left behind, facing a lonely and uncertain future."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"Hospitalizations are still low but have been rising in recent weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"The primary drug used to treat the sexually transmitted infection could be scarce into next year, Pfizer warns.

Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate some drug prices, a change that the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have opposed for decades. As he heads toward a re-election campaign next year, President Biden is betting that his success in pushing for policies intended to lower health care costs for millions of Americans will be rewarded by voters at the ballot box."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"The agency said it had found thousands of cases where minors were employed in illegal, often dangerous jobs. Congress has accused the health secretary of failing to protect them. The Labor Department on Thursday denounced a national surge in child labor, saying the agency’s inspectors had found thousands of violations and were investigating a slaughterhouse where a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala was killed this month."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"Here’s why that’s a problem, and how to fix it. Decades of research have shown that fiber-rich diets offer a range of health benefits, including healthier guts, longer lives and reduced risks of chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"Philadelphia is again the focus of a national campaign to open — or restrict — sites where people use drugs under medical supervision. Quetcy M. Lozada, a first-term Philadelphia City Council member, stood on a September evening near an elementary school just off Kensington Avenue, the epicenter of a sprawling fentanyl market in a city that saw a record 1,413 drug overdose deaths last year."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The federal government needs to stop penalizing programs that help addicts safely consume their drugs while providing treatment. It’s been two years since New York City became home to the nation’s first legally sanctioned supervised consumption program, where people can take illicit drugs like heroin, crack and methamphetamine under medical supervision. By many accounts that program is thriving. More than 1,000 potentially fatal overdoses have been reversed and many people who use the facilities have been connected to support services, including addiction treatment."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The facilities can look like luxury apartments or modest group homes, and can vary in pricing structures. Here’s a guide. Are you confused about what an assisted-living facility is, and how it differs from a nursing home? And what you can expect to pay? Here’s a guide to this type of housing for older people."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The add-ons pile up: $93 for medications, $50 for cable TV. Prices soar as the industry leaves no service unbilled. The housing option is out of reach for many families. Assisted-living centers have become an appealing retirement option for hundreds of thousands of boomers who can no longer live independently, promising a cheerful alternative to the institutional feel of a nursing home."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The condition can cause fatigue and other symptoms but is rarely tested for. Here’s what to know. Roughly 35 percent of women of reproductive age in the United States don’t have sufficient amounts of iron in their bodies. And yet the nutritional deficiency, which can affect multiple functions, from immunity to cognition, often goes undiagnosed, said Dr. Malcolm Munro, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. This oversight is partly because symptoms can be difficult to pin down but also because iron deficiency is rarely recognized as an urgent condition with short- and long-term consequences, he said."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"Doxycycline can help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Here’s how to use it. As sexually transmitted infections continue to climb in the United States, a promising tool to combat them is drawing more attention. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a draft proposal to recommend the antibiotic doxycycline as a “morning-after” pill to help prevent chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea infections among people at especially high risk."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"A neurosurgeon, he helped develop an insulin pump for diabetes patients and a device to relieve pain, and joined Ben Carson in a historic operation on conjoined infants. Donlin M. Long, a pioneering neurosurgeon whose brain research helped millions of patients manage pain and who collaborated on the invention of an implantable pump to deliver insulin to people with diabetes, died on Sept. 19 near Gettysburg, Pa. He was 89."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,Editors from publications across the U.S. shared the best journalism they published this year. The Morning newsletter asked editors at dozens of local news publications — both for-profit and nonprofit — around the country to tell us about some of their best 2023 work. Below you’ll find their stories.
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"Once accustomed to a status outside the usual management-labor hierarchy, many health professionals now feel as put upon as any clock-punching worker. Dr. John Wust does not come off as a labor agitator. A longtime obstetrician-gynecologist from Louisiana with a penchant for bow ties, Dr. Wust spent the first 15 years of his career as a partner in a small business — that is, running his own practice with colleagues."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"A new study highlights both the promise and the limitations of gene editing, as a highly lethal form of avian influenza continues to spread around the world. Scientists have used the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR to create chickens that have some resistance to avian influenza, according to a new study that was published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,New research suggests a daily vitamin can improve cognition. But that doesn’t mean everyone should take one. A new study reported that adults 60 and older who took a daily multivitamin for two years scored higher on memory and cognitive tests than those who took a placebo — a rare example of a clinical trial finding that a nutritional supplement might actually benefit healthy people.
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,Among the attendees will be the prime minister of Sweden and women who were denied an abortion and in vitro fertilization. Follow live updates on Biden’s State of the Union address.
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,"A new, high-tech approach called ECPR can restart more hearts and save more lives. Why aren’t more hospitals embracing it? Greg Hayes, an emergency first responder in Chanhassen, Minn., was picking up takeout sushi when a 911 call came in: A 61-year-old had stopped breathing at home. Hayes and his team jumped in their ambulance and were soon pulling up in front of a suburban two-story house, where paramedics and other first responders were also arriving. All of them grabbed their equipment and raced through the open garage to find a man, gray and still, on the living-room floor with his wife and stepdaughter nearby. "
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,"How to stroll with confidence in icy weather. Maybe it was the wintry morning when I stepped out of the carpool van, hit an icy patch and went skidding on my backside toward the doors of my middle school as my classmates looked on. Or the day I stood on my front porch waving goodbye to a friend and watched in terror as she slid all the way down my frozen front steps."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,"There are several factors driving the spread of the highly infectious virus, experts said. There have now been 64 measles cases in the United States this year, surpassing the total of 58 cases in all of 2023, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,"The facility, also known as a safe injection center, will be the first in Rhode Island and the only one in the U.S. outside New York City to operate openly. More than two years ago, Rhode Island became the first state in the nation to authorize overdose prevention centers, facilities where people would be allowed to use illicit drugs under professional supervision. On Thursday, the Providence City Council approved the establishment of what will be the state’s first so-called safe injection site."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,"A group of protesters chanted “Cease-fire now.” Biden supporters countered with “Four more years.” Protesters interrupted President Biden’s speech at a church in Charleston, S.C., on Monday, urging him to call for a cease-fire in Gaza."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,"Mr. Phillips is mounting a long-shot Democratic primary challenge against President Biden, whose supporters are doing a write-in campaign in New Hampshire. For Representative Dean Phillips, challenging President Biden in the Democratic primary race has produced some humbling moments, like when he failed to draw a single voter to a meet-and-greet this month."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q1,Mr. Kennedy said he had been speaking with the Jets quarterback “pretty continuously” for the past month. Update: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has selected Nicole Shanahan as his running mate.

Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"Firearms often are not stored safely in U.S. homes, a federal survey found. At the same time, gun-related suicides and injuries to children are on the rise. Many firearm owners in the United States do not securely store their guns, even when the weapon is kept loaded and there are children in the home, according to a report released on Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"As voters’ frustration has grown with sprawling tent encampments in public spaces, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping. The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation’s most liberal states."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"“Kinkeeping” plays a crucial role in a family’s health and well-being, and it’s still predominantly done by women. Every December when Erienne Fawcett was growing up, her rural Minnesota home transformed into a showcase of snowy miniature villages, complete with tiny reindeer and carolers."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"The decision is expected to prompt a rush of litigation challenging regulations across the entire federal government, from food safety to the environment. The Supreme Court’s decision on Friday to limit the broad regulatory authority of federal agencies could lead to the elimination or weakening of thousands of rules on the environment, health care, worker protection, food and drug safety, telecommunications, the financial sector and more."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"Across the country this week, Democrats are focusing on abortion issues and emphasizing Donald Trump’s role in nominating the justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, unleashing a cascade of state-level abortion bans and prompting an angry political backlash, Democrats are marking the anniversary by highlighting the role former President Donald J. Trump played in ending the constitutional right to an abortion."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"Before you decide to speak out about wrongdoing, you have to recognize it for what it is. Here is the way I remember it: The year is 1985, and a few medical students are gathered around an operating table where an anesthetized woman has been prepared for surgery. The attending physician, a gynecologist, asks the group: “Has everyone felt a cervix? Here’s your chance.” One after another, we take turns inserting two gloved fingers into the unconscious woman’s vagina."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"Alex Jones, Steve Bannon and the left-to-right pipeline. Royce White, a Black former pro basketball player who led protests in Minneapolis after the murder of George Floyd, made his first appearance on “The Alex Jones Show” about two years ago. As he spoke, it became clear that the deep suspicion of government authority that inspired him to march in the summer of 2020 had carried him into Jones’s paranoid orbit. “We all know when the time comes and authoritarianism is at its peak, the police and the troops who just take marching orders are going to be the ones forcibly vaccinating you and your kids,” he said. Jones, a purveyor of conspiracy theories about everything from 9/11 to the murder of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, was thrilled by their conversation. “You’re awesome, you’re dead-on, and we’re going to learn a lot from you,” he enthused."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"Most fitness trackers offer a wealth of heart-rate data. Here’s how to make sense of it. If you wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker, you likely already have access to a steady stream of data about your heart health."

Minnesota,2024.0,Q2,"Across the country, more intense heat, storms and fires are causing the home insurance market to start to buckle. As climate change gets worse, the immediate effects are becoming painfully obvious: More frequent and severe storms, wildfires, hurricanes and other types of extreme weather are wreaking havoc and pushing millions of Americans out of their homes each year."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"Republicans have leveled inaccurate or misleading attacks on Mr. Walz’s response to protests in the summer of 2020, his positions on immigration and his role in the redesign of Minnesota’s flag. Since Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was announced as the Democratic nominee for vice president, the Trump campaign and its allies have gone on the attack."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"The congressional voting record of the Democrat nominee for vice president shows his liberal streak, but with a deference to a conservative district’s needs. Representative Tim Walz was traveling across his conservative, rural district in 2014, holding town halls across southern Minnesota, when a voter confronted him with a prickly question about his support for the Affordable Care Act."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"Officials said 65 people in nine states have been infected in the outbreak, which has been traced to an egg farm. No deaths have been reported. A salmonella outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in nine states prompted a recall of certain brands of eggs on Friday after officials said they traced the source of the infections to a farm in Wisconsin."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"Minnesota’s governor, Vice President Harris’s new running mate, has put forth one of the most ambitious climate agendas in the country. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, a former schoolteacher who was first elected to Congress in 2006, will be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, she announced this morning, ending several days of speculation."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"Americans’ health is at risk. Every day, I get emails from people asking for help. They think I’m a lawyer. I’m not. They want to know what caused their cancer or why their farm has tested high for chemicals they’ve never heard of. They want someone to fight for them."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"Like most countries, the U.S. has no comprehensive national system for monitoring disease in companion animals — which leaves pets and people at risk. Trupanion, a Seattle-based pet insurance company, is partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a disease tracking system for pets, the company announced this week. The system will draw on insurance claims submitted to Trupanion in real time when sick dogs and cats visit the veterinarian."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"Health care systems have been putting therapists’ progress reports online, much to the surprise (and anger) of some patients. Stunned. Ambushed. Traumatized."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"It’s tempting to salute him for courage, but that would overlook the deception about his deterioration. The Israeli diplomat Abba Eban once remarked that “men and nations behave wisely when they have exhausted all other resources.” The line (a version of which is often misattributed to Winston Churchill) could hardly fit President Biden better."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"The Biden administration released data showing roughly one in seven U.S. residents had been covered by the Affordable Care Act at some point over the past decade. Nearly 50 million Americans have been covered by health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces since they opened a decade ago, according to tax data analyzed by the Treasury Department and published on Tuesday."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q3,"Previous human infections occurred in workers on farms. But community transmission of the virus remains unlikely for now, experts said. Officials in Missouri on Friday identified the first American infected with bird flu who had no known exposure to the infected animals or birds that have been plaguing the nation’s farms for more than six months."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"Two people sharing a home caught the virus without known exposure to animals. More than 30 human cases have been reported in the United States. A Missouri resident who shared a home with a patient hospitalized with bird flu in August was also infected with the virus, federal officials reported on Thursday."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"“We failed this victim 100 percent,” the Minneapolis police chief said after criticism that the shooter, who had active arrest warrants, was not taken into custody sooner. A man in Minneapolis hit a neighbor with a stick and threatened others with a knife and a gun, according to court records, and though warrants were issued, the police never arrested him. Then he shot a neighbor."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"The frozen food delivery company, known for its yellow trucks, has closed after losing ground to its competitors and renaming itself Yelloh. Yelloh, the frozen food delivery service formerly called Schwan’s Home Delivery, which had once been known for its reach with rural Americans and its direct-to-consumer business model, is closing its doors on Friday after decades of decline."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"The countdown to the election feels like an Advent calendar with a dubious remark behind each door. Vice President Kamala Harris almost never talks about what it would mean to elect a female president, nor does she speculate about why women disproportionately support her candidacy."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"The Democratic vice-presidential nominee unveiled his ticket’s plan targeted at rural voters — including those protesting his visit. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, wearing a camouflage baseball cap and red-and-black plaid flannel, took the stage on Tuesday as the skies cleared on a muddy farm in Lawrence County, Pa."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"On a swing through the Southwest, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate received a warm welcome — and had to clean up his remarks about the Electoral College. Tim Walz had scarcely set foot in Nevada on Tuesday afternoon — the third of four states he was to visit that day and the beginning of a high-stakes campaign blitz in the American Southwest — when he found himself, once again, in trouble."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"A new study adds to the evidence on hormonal contraceptives and breast cancer. But experts stressed the overall risk remains low. A study published Wednesday found that women using contraceptive intrauterine devices that deliver a certain hormone are at increased risk of breast cancer, though risk of the disease in these women remained low overall."

Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"A rise in the disease in younger people was not followed by an increase in deaths, a study found, and might be a sign of overdiagnosis. One of the first warnings came in a paper published in 2021. There was an unexpected rise in pancreatic cancer among young people in the United States from 2000 to 2018. The illness can be untreatable by the time it is discovered, a death sentence."
Minnesota,2024.0,Q4,"The outbreak has been tied to multiple brands of recalled organic carrots sold by Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Wegmans, Target, Kroger, Food Lion and Publix, among others, officials said. One person has died and 39 people have become ill in an E. coli outbreak linked to organic carrots, federal regulators said on Sunday."
Mississippi,2020.0,Q1,"Such a declaration, in the midst of a health crisis, would have to come from local authorities. While the president of the United States is often referred to as the most powerful leader on earth, there are limits to those powers, and one of them is that he cannot order Americans to leave their homes and go to work."

Mississippi,2020.0,Q1,"Joseph R. Biden Jr. widened his advantage over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary race, capturing Mississippi and Missouri as well as Michigan, with support from both black and white voters. Joseph R. Biden Jr. took command of the Democratic presidential race in decisive fashion on Tuesday, marshaling a powerful multiracial coalition in the South and the Midwest that swept aside Senator Bernie Sanders and completed Mr. Biden’s rapid transformation from a sometimes-fumbling underdog into his party’s likely nominee."
Mississippi,2020.0,Q1,"After another disappointing primary night, Mr. Sanders said he would debate Joe Biden on Sunday, and laid out the questions he planned to ask him. Here’s a full transcript.

Mississippi,2020.0,Q1,"In state after state, voters say they support liberal policies like single-payer health care, canceling student debt and the Green New Deal. But many are voting for Joe Biden, who has proposed largely moderate ideas. This was supposed to be the presidential primary race in which the progressive wing of the Democratic Party put it all together. The left was coming for power, not only moral victories. One popular podcast promised that the party’s moderates would soon “bend the knee,” as working Americans flocked to a left-wing presidential agenda."
Mississippi,2020.0,Q1,"After months of legislative inactivity, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has scheduled votes on two abortion-related bills. Democrats argue they are attacks on women’s reproductive rights. WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell is about to plunge the Senate into the nation’s culture wars with votes on bills to sharply restrict access to late-term abortions and threaten some doctors who perform them with criminal penalties, signaling that Republicans plan to make curbing a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy a central theme of their re-election campaigns this year."

Mississippi,2020.0,Q2,"A message at the scene that said, in part, “Bet you stay home now,” has led the police in Mississippi to suspect arson. The burning of a church in northern Mississippi this week is being investigated as arson because of a spray-painted message at the scene that seemed to criticize the church’s defiance of coronavirus restrictions."
Mississippi,2020.0,Q2,"Storms tore a destructive path across parts of the South, where a series of tornadoes damaged houses and commercial buildings. At least 29 people died as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms swept across the South on Sunday and early Monday, sowing destruction across at least six states, emergency officials said."
Mississippi,2020.0,Q2,"The storm carved a destructive path across six states on Sunday and Monday, causing widespread damage and cutting power to tens of thousands of customers.

Mississippi,2021.0,Q2,"Until now, the courts have saved them from their efforts to restrict the procedure. In 2012, Arizona enacted a ban on nearly all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The lower courts struck it down, and the Supreme Court refused to hear the state’s appeal."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q2,"New England is surging ahead of the national average while the South is lagging behind. Almost half of Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. But the U.S. vaccination story varies widely across regions, with New England surging ahead of the national average and much of the South lagging far behind."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q2,"Cases are surging. We need to maximize the number of inoculated frontline workers and students. The next coronavirus surge seems to be underway. Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin are among the states with rising cases, hospitalizations and intensive care occupancy, and hospitalization rates among younger people are increasing nationally. The causes of this pronounced rush of cases — the spread of a more infectious B.1.1.7 variant and lockdown fatigue — are not going away."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q2,"States and cities are continuing to resort to cash prizes and scholarships to try to overcome vaccine hesitancy.

Mississippi,2021.0,Q3,"Resistance to vaccine mandates, once a fringe position, has entered the Republican mainstream. But the governors fighting President Biden’s Covid-19 requirements impose mandates of their own.

Declaring the move “terrifying,” he wrote on Twitter: “This is still America, and we still believe in freedom from tyrants.”"
Mississippi,2021.0,Q3,"“When hospitals are understaffed, people die,” one expert warned as the U.S. health systems reach a breaking point in the face of the Delta variant. Cyndy O’Brien, an emergency room nurse at Ocean Springs Hospital on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, could not believe her eyes as she arrived for work. There were people sprawled out in their cars gasping for air as three ambulances with gravely ill patients idled in the parking lot.

Mississippi,2021.0,Q3,"What political scientists and pollsters say about how the Covid wave might affect public behavior. There were no open I.C.U. beds on Wednesday in Alabama, or in parts of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, as hospitals across the South buckled under the weight of a coronavirus surge that could have been mitigated. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths are increasing nationwide. Every day, on average, more than 800 Americans are dying from Covid-19."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q3,"Hospitalizations nationwide have increased by nearly 500 percent in the past two months, particularly across Southern states, where I.C.U. beds are filling up.

Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"N.F.L. teams have standardized support for mental wellness as their players fight social stigmas and the league’s “just play through it” ethos. Defensive lineman Solomon Thomas remembers sitting at lunch one day during his rookie season in San Francisco in 2016 and pointing out the 49ers’ team therapist at an adjacent table. “Oh no, we can’t go over there,” he said a teammate told him. “Otherwise, we look like we’re crazy.”"
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"When the Supreme Court hears arguments this fall in a big abortion case from Mississippi, it will consider dueling accounts of international practices. WASHINGTON — Not so long ago, conservatives found it maddening when U.S. judges cited foreign law in their decisions interpreting the Constitution."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"Being denied an abortion can have serious consequences for a woman’s health and livelihood. It can even be deadly. On Dec. 1, the Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court decides to uphold the Mississippi law — as it may well do — that would mean American abortion rights would no longer be protected up to the point of fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade established a right to abortion up until the point in a pregnancy when a fetus could survive outside the womb.

Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"The chief justice, known for his incremental approach to contentious issues, explored on Wednesday whether the court could uphold Mississippi’s law without totally throwing out Roe v. Wade. WASHINGTON — Much of the discussion of a Mississippi law that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy has suggested that the Supreme Court faces a binary choice: it could strike down the law and fully reaffirm Roe v. Wade, as the law’s challengers want, or it could gut the idea that the Constitution protects abortion rights at all, as Mississippi has urged."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"The trend is toward liberalizing reproductive freedom, not repressing it.  Update, May 3, 2022: A majority of Supreme Court justices has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to a Politico article on Monday night citing what it said was a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito. This guest essay was published in December, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the abortion case now before the court.The decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case currently before the Supreme Court which focuses on the question of Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, is unlikely to hinge on global data or the finer points of international law. And yet a growing cadre of briefing papers, political accords and court filings is co-opting the language of international human rights groups to argue against the basic rights and freedoms that most Americans have enjoyed for decades."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"As vaccination spread and cases fell, people suffered fewer symptoms than in late 2020, but anxiety and depression were still far more prevalent than before pandemic. The arrival of vaccines and declining Covid-19 cases in the first half of 2021 coincided with an easing of symptoms of anxiety and depression across the United States, according to survey data released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"I thought we had more time before the 1973 decision was overturned. I now believe  I was wrong. As someone who has spent my career studying the history of abortion, I thought I knew what to expect tuning into Wednesday’s oral arguments in the Supreme Court abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. It was clear that big changes were coming to U.S. abortion law, no matter what. The Mississippi law at issue bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even though Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey recognize a right to choose abortion significantly later in pregnancy. So if the court sides with Mississippi in this case — as it is widely expected to do — then American abortion rights will be fundamentally undermined."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"Both sides anticipate that a Supreme Court decision scaling back abortion rights would roil next year’s elections, with Democrats sensing an advantage. WASHINGTON — A Supreme Court ruling to weaken or overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in the middle of next year’s midterm election campaign would immediately elevate abortion rights into a defining issue and most likely reinvigorate efforts to overhaul the court itself."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"Black Americans were once far less likely than white Americans to be vaccinated. But a wave of pro-vaccine campaigns and a surge of virus deaths have narrowed that gap, experts say. TUSKEGEE, Ala. — By the time vaccines for the coronavirus were introduced late last year, the pandemic had taken two of Lucenia Williams Dunn’s close friends. Still, Ms. Dunn, the former mayor of Tuskegee, contemplated for months whether to be inoculated."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"The move by several states to lift restrictions comes as a new CBS poll found that a majority of Americans still support mask mandates, including in schools. The governors of Maryland and New Jersey defended their moves to ease Covid restrictions, saying on Sunday that falling coronavirus cases in their states justified a change even as new cases and deaths remain fairly high in some regions of the United States."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"F.D.A. inspectors said that a fumigation of the West Memphis, Ark., distribution center last month revealed more than 1,100 dead rodents. A far-reaching recall has been issued for stores in six states. The value-store chain Family Dollar said on Saturday that it had temporarily closed more than 400 stores after the discovery of a rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions at a distribution center in Arkansas touched off a far-reaching recall of food, dietary supplements, cosmetics and other products."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"With a Supreme Court ruling looming, both parties expect the issue to resonate in this year’s midterm elections.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"It never quite fit in your wallet, so it’s no surprise you may have misplaced it by now.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"Analyzing wastewater can help officials estimate how prevalent the virus is in a community and which variants are circulating.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"The rapid spread of the variant means far more people will have some immunity, at least for now, which might bode well this year for highly vaccinated countries in Europe. The astonishing spread of the Omicron variant could help set the stage for the pandemic to transition from overwhelming to manageable in Europe this year, a top health official said on Monday, potentially offering the world a glimpse at how countries can ease restrictions while keeping the virus at bay."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"The legislation is modeled after an abortion law in Mississippi that the Supreme Court appears poised to uphold in a ruling expected this summer. MIAMI — Florida legislators voted to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy on Thursday, a move that would severely restrict access to the procedure in a state that for decades has been a refuge for women from across the South."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"Getting more young school-age children vaccinated is crucial for ending the pandemic, public health officials say, and many are focusing on that group.

She was 82."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"The measure is part of a wave of stringent abortion restrictions enacted by legislators in Republican-led states. Lawmakers in Oklahoma on Tuesday approved a near-total ban on abortion, making it the latest Republican-led state to forge ahead with stringent abortion legislation as the Supreme Court weighs a case that could overturn Roe v. Wade later this year."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"The cap for private insurers was widely viewed as a violation of the strict budgetary rules that govern the reconciliation process Democrats are using to fast-track the package.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"The fast-changing status in the state is emblematic of the chaotic national landscape that has unfolded in the two weeks since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"Realizing that it’s not something you buy off the shelf. A few weeks ago, both my daughters had eczema flare-ups. This is common for my younger daughter, who will get red, itchy patches on the backs of her knees and elbows throughout the year. My older daughter hadn’t had it since she was a baby, yet there it was, an angry stripe on the inner curve of her neck. The usual remedies of diligent moisturizing and lukewarm baths were not working."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"The most urgent step the federal government can take is to ensure access to medication abortion. Barely two weeks have passed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

Several states are moving to ban abortion almost completely, abortion-rights proponents are challenging those bans in court and in some cases, judges have been asked to issue injunctions that could, for a time, prevent the bans from going into effect."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"Battles over laws related to abortion, like criminalizing out-of-state travel for the procedure, will intensify in the legal system.  While laying waste to 50 years of abortion jurisprudence, the Supreme Court — or at least four of the five members of the new hard-right majority — took pains to reassure the country that it had executed an isolated hit on an “egregiously wrong” precedent that would not reverberate in other areas of constitutional law."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"Federal officials are not relying on an established system to distribute the vaccine, slowing immunizations and burdening local health departments, critics say. Roughly 5,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine intended for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., left the national stockpile’s warehouse in Olive Branch, Miss., on July 19. They somehow ended up in Oklahoma."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"As people age, they get less satisfaction from travel, cars, clothes and appliances. If the recent rout in the stock market has you drastically cutting back your retirement spending plans, it probably means that you were counting too much on ever-rising asset prices. But a new research paper suggests that spending less at advanced ages is not necessarily a sign of failure to plan. Even people who plan perfectly do it."

Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"Yes, the easy summer days are behind us. But if you’re willing to brave the chill, autumn holds a special set of rewards. Whether you like it or not, fall is here. Soon the weather will get colder, the leaves will die and the nights will stretch longer than the days. Outdoor pools have closed and the holidays are coming. Another year is dying; that’s just how it goes."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"New shows from the idiosyncratic comedy creators Phoebe Robinson and Nathan Fielder debut on Freeform and HBO. Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, July 11-17. Details and times are subject to change."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q4,"A new motion argues that lifting the Covid-19 policy next month will open the door to a surge of migrants in their states. Fifteen states have intervened to try to keep in place a pandemic-related policy that allows the government to swiftly expel migrants arriving from Mexico, a prelude to Republican plans to push new security measures on the southern border."

Mississippi,2022.0,Q4,Foes of the procedure champion the speech of some while trying to censor others. With the dismantling of Roe v. Wade has come a push to crack down on speech and information about reproductive rights.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q4,"On June 24, the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years. How will the decision affect you and your community?

Mississippi,2022.0,Q4,"A new federal program offers hefty payments to small hospitals at risk of closing. But it comes with a bewildering requirement. CASCADE, Idaho — It was 3 a.m. at the 10-bed hospital near the River of No Return, and by every measure, Ella Wenrich should have been dead."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q4,"New data shows that the number of abortions fell by more than 10,000. In the first two months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, legal abortions nationwide declined by more than 10,000, a drop of about 6 percent, according to the first attempt at a nationwide count of abortions since the decision."

Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults. Missouri this month became the first state in the country to severely restrict gender treatments for people of all ages, following a series of quieter moves across the country that have been chipping away at transgender adults’ access to medical care."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,"After Justice Clarence Thomas cast doubt on the Supreme Court decision that established a right to contraception, reproductive rights advocates are pressing for new protections at the state level. One year after Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court should reconsider whether the Constitution affords Americans a right to birth control, Democrats and reproductive rights advocates are laying the groundwork for state-by-state battles over access to contraception — an issue they hope to turn against Republicans in 2024."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,The measure is one of several recently enacted by states aiming to expand access to medication abortion for patients who live where it is outlawed. The New York State Legislature gave final approval on Tuesday to legislation that provides legal protection for New York doctors to prescribe and send abortion pills to patients in states that have outlawed abortion.

Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,"The rule would chiefly affect plants along the Gulf Coast, the Ohio River Valley and in West Virginia. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Thursday proposed a new regulation to significantly reduce hazardous air pollutants from chemical plants, a move that environmental advocates predicted would significantly reduce the health risks to  people living near industrial sites."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,"Here is the full list of winners and finalists. The Pulitzer committee honored the A.P. for the work of Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant, citing their “courageous reporting from the besieged city of Mariupol that bore witness to the slaughter of civilians in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”"
Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,"The commemoration is intended to remember, honor and salute the nation’s fallen service members. But not all of those we should recognize fit neatly into that definition. In 1866, four women placing spring flowers on the graves of Confederate soldiers at Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Miss., noticed that the nearby graves of Union soldiers were barren. They took it upon themselves to decorate those, too."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,"The measure would allow parents to cancel the contracts underlying their children’s accounts on sites like TikTok, Instagram, Roblox and YouTube. Over the last year, state legislators concerned about a mental health crisis among the nation’s young people have passed a raft of children’s online safety measures. A new Utah law would require social networks to obtain a parent’s consent before giving an account to a child younger than 18 while a new California law would require many sites to turn on the highest privacy settings for minors."

Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"The longtime Democratic leader, who has served in the House for close to four decades, also left the door open to running again. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Senator Dianne Feinstein for remaining in office after a series of health issues, dismissing concerns about Ms. Feinstein’s continued ability to serve as a sexist double standard."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"Dangerous temperatures continue in Texas and the Southeast, with daily record temperatures possible from Florida to California. The forecast for the start of August feels very similar to the one for the start of July, with most of the Southeast, the Southern Plains and once again the Southwest facing temperatures or heat indexes in the triple digits."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"After Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, some feared that other court rulings, including the 2003 decision that invalidated sodomy laws, could be revisited. Maryland and Minnesota recently repealed theirs. It has been 20 years since the Supreme Court invalidated sodomy laws with its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, but legal codes inherited from colonial laws and used to prosecute L.G.B.T.Q. people by banning some sexual acts remain in place across the country."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"Some say the facilities, which focus on autonomy in childbirth, could lead to better health outcomes — but officials are tightening rules, citing risk. Gabrielle Glaze felt scolded and shamed when she delivered her first son in a Birmingham, Ala., hospital, forced to observe strict rules about lying stationary through her contractions and enduring countless cervical checks from “total strangers” who seemed disappointed by her body’s progress."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"States can push hospitals to look at California’s model and other proven ways to reduce maternal mortality. Years ago, researchers discovered that American women were dying in childbirth at an alarming rate, far higher than in many other Western countries. Black women, they found, were dying at even more elevated rates. Data in hand, they called for change."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"Harris Wolobah, a 14-year-old in Worcester, Mass., died after he ate a Paqui brand tortilla chip dusted with two of the world’s hottest peppers, his mother said.

Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"Senators steered clear of the social policy dictates that sapped Democratic support for the House bill, but the legislation was headed for a contentious negotiation to reach a final agreement. The Senate on Thursday gave overwhelming approval to the annual defense policy bill, sidestepping a contentious debate over abortion access for service members and quashing efforts to limit aid for Ukraine in a show of bipartisanship that set up a bitter showdown with the House."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"Sheriff Eddie Scott has been the top lawman in rural Clay County, Miss., for more than a decade despite repeated allegations. In 2012, three months after Eddie Scott became sheriff of Clay County, Miss., a claim by a woman he had helped put behind bars threatened to tarnish his earliest days in office."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q3,"The department outlined several cases, including one in which the defendants were accused of using fraudulently obtained funds to solicit a murder. For more than two years, Leon Haynes, a New Jersey tax preparer, told some of his clients that the federal government was giving out “free money” in the form of pandemic relief to people who owned businesses. According to federal prosecutors, Mr. Haynes filed more than 1,000 false tax forms, fraudulently claiming more than $124 million in Covid-19 employment tax credits for businesses that he and others owned."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,"Tens of millions of dollars have been pumped into today’s elections, in a sign of their national implications.

Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,"A Times investigation reveals the behind-the-scenes story of how the Supreme Court abolished the constitutional right to abortion. By the time the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, a draft of the ruling had been leaked to the press and the outcome was anticipated. The story behind the decision seemed obvious: The constitutional right to abortion effectively had died with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose replacement, Amy Coney Barrett, was a favorite of the anti-abortion movement."

Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,"Firefighters have been fighting to contain fires in Virginia, North Carolina and other states. Wildfires caused by drought, warmer-than-normal temperatures and, in a few cases, possibly arson have been ablaze for days in several Southern states. The threat has led officials to enact burn bans and to stop issuing safe-burn permits."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,"Bettersten Wade spent months calling the police for help finding her son, without being told that an off-duty officer driving an S.U.V. had fatally struck him on the same day she last saw him. For months, Bettersten Wade called the police in Jackson, Miss., desperate for any update or sign that detectives were making progress in tracking down Dexter, her 37-year-old son who left their home one day in March and vanished."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,It’s very hard to determine when an abortion is medically necessary. Many people were shocked when the Texas Supreme Court intervened recently to stop Kate Cox from getting an abortion in the state — an abortion needed to protect her health and future fertility after her fetus was diagnosed with a severe fetal anomaly in her second trimester. She ultimately traveled out of state to get the abortion she needed.
Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,How the justices overturned Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court deliberates in secret. Insiders who speak can be cast out of the fold. Learning about the justices’ internal debates over cases can require decades-long waits for their papers to become public.

Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,"The $886 billion legislation is the product of bipartisan negotiations between the House and Senate in which right-wing restrictions on abortion, transgender care and diversity initiatives were jettisoned. The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed an $886 billion defense bill that would set Pentagon policy and provide a 5.2 percent pay raise for military personnel, defying the demands of Republicans who failed to attach a raft of deeply partisan restrictions on abortion, transgender care and diversity initiatives."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q4,"The first estimate of births since Dobbs found that almost a quarter of women who would have gotten abortions carried their pregnancies to term. The first data on births since Roe v. Wade was overturned shows how much abortion bans have had their intended effect: Births increased in every state with a ban, an analysis of the data shows."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"Its decision that embryos are people offers a warning of the future toward which America may be heading. I never thought I’d be grateful to the Alabama Supreme Court for anything, but now I am. With its decision deeming frozen embryos to be children under state law, that all-Republican court has done the impossible. It has awakened the American public, finally, to the peril of the theocratic future toward which the country has been hurtling."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"The idea is noble, but it faces very tough odds. John Chambers grew up in West Virginia and went on to run what was once the world’s most valuable company, the computer networking firm Cisco Systems Inc. Now he is trying to help economically lagging West Virginia by making it a “start-up state” akin to Israel, which has been called the start-up nation. I interviewed Chambers recently about his hopes and the magnitude of the challenge."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"A new report based on records from the Trump and Biden years found the average length of solitary detainment was longer than the duration the U.N. says can constitute torture. The United States government has placed detained immigrants in solitary confinement more than 14,000 times in the last five years, and the average duration is almost twice the 15-day threshold that the United Nations has said may constitute torture, according to a new analysis of federal records by researchers at Harvard and the nonprofit group Physicians for Human Rights."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"An Alabama decision on I.V.F. has put an uncompromising principle on a collision course with political reality. In vitro fertilization creates life, in the most literal sense. The procedure offers a chance to make a baby, with eggs that are fertilized and develop into embryos in a lab. I.V.F. has helped countless people have children, including couples struggling with infertility and an increasing number of L.G.B.T.Q. parents. In a sense, it’s the opposite of an abortion, which ends a pregnancy."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"The number from officials and news reports is likely to rise as authorities assess the fallout from the extreme conditions in many parts of the country. At least 72 people across the United States have died from weather-related causes after more than a week of frigid winter storms and brutally cold temperatures, according to reports from state officials, police departments, medical examiners and news outlets."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"Doctors in six states where abortion is legal are using new laws to send abortion pills to tens of thousands of women in states where it is illegal. Behind an unmarked door in a boxy brick building outside Boston, a quiet rebellion is taking place. Here, in a 7-by-12-foot room, abortion is being made available to thousands of women in states where it is illegal."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"Experts explain how to tell if you have allergies, and how to find relief if you do. Spring is here — and if you’re among the estimated one in four adults in the United States who suffers from seasonal allergies, you may be sneezing and scratching."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"Both Donald J. Trump and President Biden are over 75. But voters are much less likely to worry that Mr. Trump is too old to serve. Donald J. Trump has praised Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, for his leadership of Turkey, and confused Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi. President Biden has named dead former European leaders when describing his contemporary peers, and referred to Egypt as Mexico."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"Pollution is contributing to Black Americans’ decision to move South, in a trend that is as worrying as it is moving. The air pollution in Emma Lockridge’s community in Detroit was often so bad, she had to wear a surgical mask inside her house. The smokestacks of nearby refineries and factories filled the sky outside her windows with black particles. “I couldn’t sleep because of those fumes,” she told me last year."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q1,"The Bodacious Belles, a women’s group in Beaufort, N.C., shows the difference a network of support can make in an aging America. Martha Barnes’s home was buzzing. It was a Saturday in little Beaufort, N.C., time to get ready for the town’s Mardi Gras parade, and women were zigzagging around the house, applying makeup, laughing and calling out repeatedly for the Fireball Cinnamon Whisky sitting on the kitchen counter."

Mississippi,2024.0,Q2,"He diagnosed dozens of patients with what he said were suppressed memories of being tortured by cults. He later lost his license. Bennett Braun, a Chicago psychiatrist whose diagnoses of repressed memories involving horrific abuse by devil worshipers helped to fuel what became known as the “satanic panic” of the 1980s and ’90s, died on March 20 in Lauderhill, Fla., north of Miami. He was 83."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q2,The anti-vax sentiment coursing through his die-hards shows how Trump takes his cues from his base. Former President Donald Trump’s chaotic and denial-filled response to the Covid-19 pandemic turned off independent voters and arguably cost him the 2020 presidential election.

Mississippi,2024.0,Q2,"In “The Fall of Roe,” Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer explain exactly how Roe v. Wade was made — and unmade. In 2020, a writer at the feminist website Jezebel pitched an article on abortion pills. Her editor liked the idea, but knew what those of us who have tried to write about reproductive access had long internalized: The piece would not do well."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q2,"Mr. Kennedy has become the most prominent independent or third-party presence in the 2024 race. The independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has emerged as a wild card of the 2024 election, attracting a motley mix of ideologically diverse supporters, raising piles of cash and drawing legal attacks from Democrats and verbal barrages from former President Donald J. Trump."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q2,"Marilyn Lands’s victory in a special election provided an early blueprint for Democrats who are eager to make reproductive rights central to their campaigns. When Marilyn Lands, a Democrat, won an election last month for a northern Alabama State House district that Republicans had held for more than two decades, she stretched the political power of reproductive rights into the edges of Appalachia."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q2,"They’ve been linked to reproductive disorders and cancers. Why are they still being marketed so aggressively to Black women? The phone rang incessantly in Dr. Tamarra James-Todd’s office at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “I’m sorry,” she said, excusing herself for the third time. “It’s happening a lot,” she explained after pausing to take another call, “with the F.D.A. thing.”"
Mississippi,2024.0,Q2,"The vice president is set to lean into a partywide attack on Donald Trump and fellow Republicans, who are newly on the defensive over the issue. Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Arizona on Friday to assail former President Donald J. Trump over abortion restrictions, with plans to blame him for bans in the state and across the country."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"The vice president should triple down on the issue to clinch this race. Among the many critical issues at stake in the 2024 election, one will be central for many Americans: Whom do you trust to make medical decisions — women and their doctors, or Donald Trump and JD Vance?"
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,A court ruling that deemed frozen embryos “children” has motivated some patients and clinics to move embryos out of red states. An emerging movement against in vitro fertilization is driving some doctors and patients in red states to move or destroy frozen embryos.
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"They are called supercentenarians, and they have seen it all. One of the oldest men in the world died in August at the age of 111. The man, John Farringdon, was born about a year after the Titanic sank."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"More than 50,000 American Catholics gathered at the first National Eucharistic Congress since the 1940s. Lucas Oil Stadium, the vast brick home to the Indianapolis Colts, is space custom-built for commotion and cacophony. On Wednesday night, the seats were mostly filled, families having shuffled into rows balancing paper trays of chicken fingers and pizza. But at 7 p.m., the lights went down, and the crowd sat poised in stillness and silence."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"Some participants have been attending for decades, while others will be voting in their first general election this year. Among the nearly 4,700 delegates gathered in Chicago this week for the Democratic National Convention: United States senators and representatives. Top state officials. Leaders of major advocacy groups and labor unions. Democrats aspiring to become one or more of the above."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"Kamala Harris’s running mate was picked for his rapport with Middle America, but his progressive record as governor parallels his state’s move toward more liberal politics. When the voters of southern Minnesota shocked the Republican establishment in 2006 and elected a Democratic newcomer to represent their largely rural district, their new congressman, Tim Walz, repeatedly reached out his hand."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"During segregation, Lincoln Beach was the only place on Lake Pontchartrain where Black people were allowed to swim. Now, after years of neglect and the intervention of local volunteers, it’s on the edge of revival. During segregation, Lincoln Beach was the one place on Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans where Black people were allowed to swim. Live acts like Fats Domino and Nat King Cole drew crowds to a recreation area that included a roller coaster and swimming pools. But with passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, Black New Orleanians were finally allowed to swim at nearby Pontchartrain Beach. Lincoln Beach closed not long after."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"Democrats should fight for religious voters.

Brown of San Francisco’s Third Baptist Church, Mississippi Today reported in July."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"The social media company will use its Community Notes program to moderate lies about the election, but cracks are already appearing. Less than an hour after President Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate for president on Sunday, users on X falsely claimed she was “ineligible” to run for office because her parents were not born in the United States."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q3,"Republicans may be backing away from abortion, but these activists have a strategy, with or without Trump. The pivot seems clear. The Republican Party of the post-Roe era is sidelining anti-abortion activists. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint with innovative abortion bans, has been disavowed by Donald Trump. And the new G.O.P. platform even promises to advance access to in vitro fertilization."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q4,"A new analysis shows how many women in states with bans are seeking procedures or pills from out-of-state providers. In nearly every state that has banned abortion, the number of women receiving abortions increased between 2020 and the end of 2023, according to the most comprehensive account of all abortions by state since the overturning of Roe v. Wade."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q4,"The president said the aid was “urgently needed” as emergency programs face funding shortfalls amid the devastation after Hurricanes Helene and Milton and a string of other natural disasters. President Biden urged Congress on Monday to provide nearly $100 billion in “urgently needed” aid for communities ravaged by hurricanes and other disasters in recent months, saying funding for some critical programs has either run out or is nearly exhausted."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q4,"The abortion rights movement won in many states — even some that voted for Donald Trump. Where does it go from here? In the first few elections after the Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade, the abortion rights movement created reason for hope among its supporters: It won a string of unexpected victories in ballot measures from conservative states like Kansas and Ohio to moderate ones like Michigan."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q4,"The biggest pharmacy benefit managers are profiting by systematically underpaying independent drugstores, creating “pharmacy deserts” across the country. The small-town drugstore closed for the last time on a clear and chilly afternoon in February. Jon Jacobs, who owned Yough Valley Pharmacy, hugged his employees goodbye. He cleared the shelves and packed pill bottles into plastic bins."
Mississippi,2024.0,Q4,"NetChoice, backed by tech giants including Meta and Google, has successfully argued in court that Big Tech hosts protected speech.

In December, I wrote a newsletter with the headline, “Overturning Roe Will Make Miscarriage Care Worse.” I pointed out that because the options that doctors have to end a miscarriage that doesn’t happen on its own — medication or surgery — are the same ones involved in an abortion, outlawing abortion would have a chilling effect on medical providers, as evidenced by cases in countries such as Malta and Poland where abortion is severely restricted."

In July 2019, The Upshot, an arm of The New York Times that focuses on data-driven journalism, published the article “Where Roe v. Wade Has the Biggest Effect.” Written by the journalists Margot Sanger-Katz, Claire Cain Miller and Quoctrung Bui, the article examined what would happen if Roe v.

Using research, it estimated what could happen under various scenarios, and with maps, displayed what at that point was an alternate reality."

BOZEMAN, Mont. — The idea was to be permanently chastened by the Civil War, that the relief of emancipation and reunification would always be tempered by the shock of 600,000 corpses.

Montana,2022.0,Q4,"President Biden’s low profile on the campaign trail reflects a low approval rating that makes him unwelcome in some congressional districts and states at a pivotal moment before the midterms.

Montana,2022.0,Q4,"Disputes over compensation and firings, and potentially over layoffs, could push both sides into fresh legal battles. Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter may have closed, but his battle with the company’s board and executives seems to be barreling forward. After what DealBook hears was a bitter closing on Thursday, Musk is taunting Twitter and the law firm it worked with in its lawsuit against him, Wachtell Lipton, with the prospect of litigation, while trying to avoid paying top executives the golden parachutes they’re owed. It appears that fraught legal battles lie ahead, and it’s unclear whether Musk’s aim is to win or simply punish."

Montana,2023.0,Q2,"Fixing the background check system can be done today, but it will take work. A litany of exasperating rituals flows from America’s regular mass shootings. One of the most frustrating is the hand-wringing that our politics is so polarized that there’s no way to move forward."

At the time, vaccines were available, but new variants continued to emerge. I viewed my primary charge as bringing this country from the dark and tragic pandemic days into a more restored place."
Montana,2023.0,Q2,"A months-long event, just outside the park, was intended to keep the animals from spreading a disease to livestock. But its scope and other removal measures affecting hundreds more have generated opposition.

Montana,2023.0,Q4,"The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage. For 35 years, Angela Jemmott and her five brothers paid premiums on a long-term care insurance policy for their 91-year-old mother. But the policy does not cover home health aides whose assistance allows her to stay in her Sacramento bungalow, near the friends and neighbors she loves. Her family pays $4,000 a month for that."

Montana,2023.0,Q4,"Children are suffering under the weight of social media. New York lawmakers believe they have a strategy to halt the damage. Over the past few years, hundreds of families and school districts around the country have sued big tech companies on the grounds that the hypnotic properties of social media popular with children have left too many of them unwell. Citing the promotion of the “corpse bride” diet, for example, and other practices around dangerous forms of weight loss, Seattle Public Schools filed a complaint in January arguing that platforms like TikTok and Snapchat have been so unsparing in their delivery of harmful material to students that the resulting anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation were interfering with the school system’s primary mission of educating children."

Montana,2023.0,Q4,"Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times. Two of our recommended books this week use fiction to delve into Korean history and its relation to America, to strikingly different effect: Ed Park’s novel “Same Bed Different Dreams” is a sprawling, exuberant confection rife with wordplay and shades of Thomas Pynchon or Don DeLillo, while Paul Yoon’s “The Hive and the Honey” is a pointillist collection of spare, evocative short stories whose power derives from their restraint. Taken together the contrast is bracing, like sea salt and caramel, but of course you can choose to read either one without the other; we serve all tastes."
Montana,2023.0,Q4,"The shooting in Lewiston that left 18 dead prompted the town’s conservative Democratic representative to embrace an assault weapons ban, but Senators Susan Collins and Angus King are still resisting.

Montana,2024.0,Q1,"The candidate challenging President Biden “didn’t understand DEI until recently,” Mr. Ackman said. After an endorsement and super PAC donation, the Phillips campaign site changed course. The campaign website for Representative Dean Phillips, the Minnesota Democrat mounting a long-shot primary challenge to President Biden, has a policy platform that signals liberal bona fides tempered by a Midwestern businessman’s practicality. It includes headers like “Climate Action,” “Women’s Health and Economic Security” and “Immigration Reform.”"
Montana,2024.0,Q1,"As housing costs soar, Washington State wants to limit annual rent increases to 7 percent. Oregon and California have passed similar measures.

Montana,2024.0,Q1,"Pushed by an advocacy group, Arkansas became the first state to shield noisy cryptocurrency operators from unhappy neighbors.

Nebraska,2021.0,Q4,"The lawsuit was filed a day after the announcement of a Jan. 4 deadline for the companies to begin their mandates or start weekly testing. The attorneys general in 11 states filed a lawsuit on Friday in an effort to prevent the Biden administration from requiring large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations, the latest sign of growing pushback against the federal government’s biggest effort yet to enlist private businesses in combating the virus."
Nebraska,2021.0,Q4,"More than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in the yearlong period ending in April, government researchers said. Americans died of drug overdoses in record numbers as the pandemic spread across the country, federal researchers reported on Wednesday, the result of lost access to treatment, rising mental health problems and wider availability of dangerously potent street drugs."
Nebraska,2021.0,Q4,"Public health experts fear that the highly contagious variant cannot be stopped without harsh measures that the public will no longer tolerate. Even as President Biden on Tuesday outlined new plans for battling the highly contagious Omicron variant, public health experts warned that the measures would not be sufficient to prevent a grim rise in infections and hospitalizations over the next few weeks."
Nebraska,2021.0,Q4,"Since vaccines became widely available in April, nearly 250,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States. Their demographics are different from earlier in the pandemic.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"With the virus widespread in white-tailed deer, scientists wonder which animals might be next. Barbara Han, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, knew it was a question of when, not if, the coronavirus would spread to animals. As the first reports of infected animals appeared in 2020, she began working on an artificial intelligence model that would predict which creatures might be next."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"Insect feces and exoskeletons can make agriculture more sustainable and produce less waste, scientists say. Insects excrete, just as we do, but their feces have a more pleasing name: frass. Unlike us, insects molt as they grow up, producing a series of crinkly silhouettes of their outgrown exoskeletons, also called exuviae."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"G.O.P. candidates, tapping into voters’ frustrations with a seemingly endless pandemic, are stepping up their attacks on Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. COLUMBUS, Ohio — When Jane Timken kicked off an eight-week advertising campaign on the Fox News Channel in her bid for the Republican nomination for Senate, she did not focus on immigration, health care or the economy. Her first ad was titled “Fire Fauci.”"

Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"Why is the “Sex and the City” reboot populated by adults who seem perplexed by everything from politics to their own bodies? Have you heard? There’s a TV show featuring 50-somethings on HBO, right now. “And Just Like That,” the reboot of “Sex and the City,” has resurrected the old gang (Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte — minus Samantha) in present-day New York City, 17 years after the last episode aired.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"With top House Democrats skeptical of barring lawmakers from owning individual stocks, a simmering issue has exploded, especially among members facing difficult re-election races. WASHINGTON — Facing stiff political headwinds and a flagging election-year agenda, the most vulnerable Democrats in Congress have found a way to distance themselves from their leaders: demanding an end to stock trading for all members of Congress, including senior lawmakers who are clearly leery."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"At Iona, Pitino doesn’t have the “bells and whistles” of Louisville, which he left amid scandal. But he has a team undefeated in conference play and looking to return to the N.C.A.A. tournament. NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. — Sunday was not unfolding as planned for the Iona College men’s basketball team. Visiting St. Peter’s was playing rough-and-tumble ball, which had landed Iona in foul trouble and out of sorts. The frustration was evident when Nelly Junior Joseph, a sophomore center for Iona, tussled fiercely enough over a held ball with St. Peter’s Hassan Drame that both players drew technical fouls in an incident that nearly precipitated a brawl."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"Instead of breaking up the big meatpacking companies, the Biden administration is supporting the creation of  rivals. MARCUS, Iowa — The last time the federal government decided that a few big meatpacking firms were abusing their market power, in the early 1920s, it chopped those companies into smaller pieces."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q1,"Her Supreme Court nomination hearing is a digressively ugly free-for-all. If you thought that a misadventure in Cancún would tame Ted Cruz — would put bounds on his boasts, a cap on his condescension — then you sorely underestimated the Texas senator."

The 67 clinics operating in neighboring states could stop offering abortions or close altogether, sending thousands more patients to Illinois."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"Both Republicans peppered their speeches with repeated jabs at Stacey Abrams, the likely Democratic nominee for governor. KENNESAW, Ga. — Former Vice President Mike Pence brought a closing message to Gov. Brian Kemp’s campaign for the Republican nomination for governor on Monday, headlining a rally for Mr. Kemp that was just as much about Tuesday’s primary as it was about his November matchup against Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"Democratic interference in Republican primaries paid off in some places but not others, election-denying candidates were halted in Colorado, and incumbents proved their staying power. The biggest question heading into Tuesday’s primaries was whether Democrats would be successful in guiding Republican voters to choose weak nominees for the general election."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"The downfall of the constitutional right to abortion began 12 years ago, after Republicans swept state house elections and passed hundreds of restrictions.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"The lone star tick can trigger an allergic reaction to red meat in those bitten. Now this arachnid’s territory is expanding. One night in 2008, Deborah Fleshman awoke in her bed to find that her legs had turned beetroot red. Welts, some a foot wide, had appeared along her torso."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"Mr. Perdue, who badly trails Gov. Brian Kemp in the Republican primary for governor, accused Ms. Abrams of “demeaning her own race” in describing the state’s problems. DUNWOODY, Ga. — Former Senator David Perdue ended his Trump-inspired campaign for governor of Georgia with a racist appeal to Republican primary voters on Monday, accusing Stacey Abrams, the Black woman who is the presumptive Democratic nominee, of “demeaning her own race” in how she has described the state’s problems."

Cordileone, who has repeatedly confronted the House speaker over her backing of abortion rights, said her stance was a “grave evil.” WASHINGTON — An ultraconservative archbishop in San Francisco said on Friday that Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California would not be permitted to receive communion in his archdiocese because of her support for abortion rights."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"Abortion will remain legal in about half of states, but the rest will probably ban it. The number of abortions will probably fall, particularly among poor women in the South and Midwest. Follow our live updates on the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"After a string of Democratic failures on marquee issues, Senator Chuck Schumer’s decision to give bipartisan gun talks time is a test of the Senate — and of democracy itself. WASHINGTON — The decision of the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, to try for a negotiated compromise on new gun laws in the wake of the latest pair of mass shootings may prove to be a high-stakes bet on representative democracy itself, made at a time when faith in Congress — and the Senate in particular — is in tatters in both parties."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"Worried about inflation and dissatisfied with President Biden, many moderate women have been drifting away from Democrats. Now the party hopes the fight for abortion rights will drive them back. GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — As Gov. Gretchen Whitmer prepared to kick off a round-table discussion about abortion rights at a brewery recently, Alisha Meneely sat at one corner of the table, feeling politically abandoned."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"The tentative deal would close an investigation by nearly three dozen states into the company’s marketing and sales practices.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"An effort in Indiana to pass an abortion ban with exceptions has exposed rifts among conservatives on how to legislate in a post-Roe world. INDIANAPOLIS — Abortion opponents, especially in conservative states, had hoped to swiftly pass a new wave of restrictions after Roe v. Wade was overturned. But so far, most Republican lawmakers have moved cautiously or done nothing at all, even in statehouses where they hold overwhelming majorities."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"Feeling jittery about math — and altogether avoiding it — “is a serious handicap” that often affected women, she wrote in Ms. magazine in 1976, followed by a book on the subject. When Sheila Tobias finished her freshman year at Radcliffe College in 1954, her professor in a natural sciences course congratulated her on her performance. But for many years she was troubled that he had not encouraged her to take more science classes. When she finally asked him, he said that her limited science background had already made her ineligible for a science career."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"The law passed despite dividing Republicans. Some of them said the measure was too restrictive; others objected to limited exceptions for rape and incest. INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana lawmakers passed and the governor signed a near-total ban on abortion on Friday, overcoming division among Republicans and protests from Democrats to become the first state to draw up and approve sweeping new limits on the procedure since Roe v. Wade was struck down in June."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"Plus a Ukrainian nuclear plant is under threat. Two years ago, Najib Razak, Malaysia’s former prime minister, was convicted of corruption for participating in a multibillion-dollar scandal. On Tuesday, the nation’s highest court rejected his final appeal, and now the former leader is headed to prison to serve a 12-year sentence."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"Nearly 12 percent of respondents said it was at least “sometimes justified” to use violence if it meant returning Donald J. Trump to the presidency. One in five adults in the United States would be willing to condone acts of political violence, a new national survey commissioned by public health experts found, revelations that they say capture the escalation in extremism that was on display during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"Bleary-eyed senators went through a marathon series of votes at the Capitol that was the final step before passing Democrats’ climate, energy and tax package. WASHINGTON — A bleary-eyed Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat who brokered the climate, health and tax deal that was on a glide path to passage within hours, sat silently at his desk in the Senate chamber around midnight on Saturday, gazing blankly into the middle distance as he munched on M&Ms."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"Checking in with activists from sanctuary states who have spent more than 50 years fighting abortion. For local veterans of the anti-abortion movement, the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision reversing Roe v.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q3," This may be a year when politics gets flipped on its head. Forget Hot Girl Summer. We just came off Hot Primary Summer, which featured fewer tequila shots than the Megan Thee Stallion-inspired original — unless, maybe, you were partying with Dr. Oz — but still packed way more drama than you’d expect in a midterm election cycle."

HUNTINGTON, N.Y. — At the first of two rowdy shows here at the Paramount Theater on a weeknight last month, the standup comic Nurse Blake walked onstage and asked if any of the more than 1,000 people there were drinking. After a cheer, he quipped: “Probably E.R. nurses.”"
Nebraska,2022.0,Q4,"The House voted to force rail companies and workers to accept a pending agreement and to add seven days of paid leave, a key demand of the employees. But it met with a rocky reception in the Senate. WASHINGTON — The House on Wednesday resoundingly approved legislation that would avert a nationwide rail strike by imposing a labor agreement between rail companies and their workers, as lawmakers rushed to shield the economy from the threat of a holiday-season work stoppage that would disrupt shipping across the country."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q4,"The overturning of Roe v. Wade got people to the polls. Democrats must learn from that. Support for abortion rights appears to have been a major factor in the midterm elections, helping Democrats fare much better than expected in many places. Though Republicans seized control of the House, dashing hopes of federal legislation to codify Roe v. Wade in the next two years, the midterm results suggest that running on abortion can be a winning strategy for Democrats. The outcome offers lessons to Democrats looking ahead to a 2024 presidential election that could determine if a federal abortion ban is on the table."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q4,Voters supported abortion rights in several states and elected governors friendly to access in some of the most competitive races. Other states may see more restrictions.

She was 71."

Nebraska,2022.0,Q4,"Worried about coaxing people into pews when they’d rather be in their pajamas, some Protestant pastors are canceling Sunday services on Dec. 25. StoneBridge Christian Church in eastern Nebraska is known locally for hosting a big annual fireworks event, which this fall included 15 food trucks and portable firepits for making s’mores. But it’s the Christmas season that is “our Super Bowl,” said the church’s executive pastor, Mitch Chitwood. This year, the church’s four locations in the Omaha area will host four “Jingle Jam” family parties in December and nine services on Christmas Eve, complete with classic carols, Christmas-themed coffee drinks and a festive photo booth in the lobby."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q4,"Doctors and midwives in blue states are working to get abortion pills into red states — setting the stage for a historic legal clash. When Linda Prine learned she was pregnant in 1970, she was a first-year college student in Wisconsin, where abortion was largely illegal. The doctor who gave her the news saw the look on Prine’s face and handed her a slip of paper with a phone number. Prine waited until other students in her dorm left for class to call from a phone in the hallway. The woman she spoke to gave her the names of psychiatrists and told her to persuade them that she would be suicidal if she were to have a baby. Prine followed the instructions and was able to get an appointment for an abortion at the university hospital. "

Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"Recent tactics constitute an attack on the idea of representation itself. On Tuesday, I wrote about the Republican effort to limit the reach and scope of initiatives and referendums as another instance of the party’s war on majority rule. One thing I wanted to include, but couldn’t quite integrate into the structure of the column, was a point about the recent use of legislative expulsion to punish Democratic lawmakers who dissent from or challenge Republican majorities."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"In the past three months, 10 Republican-led states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors. Ten states in the past three months have passed laws prohibiting what is known as gender-affirming care for young people, in a rapid effort by Republican lawmakers across the country."

Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"More companies are pushing low-calorie, sugar-free beverages they say are healthy. Some servings have nearly the same level of caffeine as a six-pack of Coca-Cola. It has been more than 25 years since Red Bull hit the market and introduced caffeinated energy drinks to the United States. While the company claimed its beverage would “give you wings,” it never said it was actually good for people."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"The case had been closely watched as an important test of whether bans on transition care for minors, enacted by more than a dozen states, could withstand challenges.

Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"House G.O.P. lawmakers in competitive seats who could be crucial to averting a catastrophic default are being fawned over by Democrats one minute and pummeled the next. Representative Mike Lawler, the first-term Republican from a Hudson Valley suburb who is widely considered one of the most politically endangered members of his party, began the week facing brutal attacks from a major House Democratic political group that falsely accused him of trying to force cuts to Medicare and Social Security."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"As DeSantis announces his campaign, we dig into what may be the single most important fact about U.S. politics. If Ronald Reagan were to come back to life, he would probably be confused by the leftist tone that the early 2024 Republican presidential campaign has sometimes taken."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"With single-party statehouse control at its highest level in decades, legislators across much of the country leaned into cultural issues and bulldozed the opposition.

Parts of the U.S. had unhealthy air in June from wildfires in other parts of Canada. Smoke from wildfires in Western Canada drifted across the Midwest and the Northeast of the United States on Monday, blotting out blue sky and sun and blanketing dozens of cities with unhealthy air that triggered warnings to limit the time spent outdoors."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"Gov. Kim Reynolds called the Legislature for a special session to consider sweeping new restrictions on abortion. Less than a month after a deadlocked Iowa Supreme Court left a six-week abortion ban unenforceable, lawmakers returned to the State Capitol on Tuesday and passed a nearly identical set of restrictions on the procedure."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"American women are seeking help from Mexico for abortions, crystallizing the shifting policies of two nations that once held vastly different positions on the procedure. The text message Cynthia Menchaca received this summer was one she was seeing more and more: A woman living in Texas said she had left a violent relationship only to discover she was pregnant, and she desperately wanted an abortion. The woman had learned that Ms. Menchaca could send her abortion pills from Mexico, where the procedure has been decriminalized in several states."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated. In the wake of the decision, 15 largely conservative states imposed near-total bans (through trigger laws or new legislation), and two more set limits at six weeks of pregnancy. "
Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"Participants in The New York Times Climate Forward event sum up their views on the response to the crisis — and the challenges for young people. The urgent need to address the conditions that are causing climate change — and to lessen the impact as temperatures climb and environmental catastrophes mount — has drawn widespread engagement from governments, politicians, industries, scientists, advocacy groups and concerned citizens. Leaders from many of the fields will be speaking, presenting and discussing their efforts at The New York Times Climate Forward event in New York on Thursday. We asked a sampling of participants to reply in advance to three questions about the state of the response to the environmental challenges. Their answers, which have been edited and condensed, are included here."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"New research reveals the vast scope of the Native American boarding school system, which for more than a century removed Native children from their homes and families in an effort to assimilate them.

A historian turns her eye to the country of her birth in this political history of the German Democratic Republic, which existed from 1949 to 1990. Contrary to common depictions, Hoyer presents a picture of a vibrant society that weathered intense state suppression but also enacted solidarity."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"The vehicle is a key part of the justice’s just-folks persona. It’s also a luxury motor coach that was funded by someone else’s money. Justice Clarence Thomas met the recreational vehicle of his dreams in Phoenix, on a November Friday in 1999."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"For Marcos Cux — and thousands of other migrant children — working dangerous jobs that violate child-labor laws is the only American dream there is. Late on a Thursday in February 2022, Marcos Cux, who had just turned 14, bundled up in green rubberized overalls and a matching jacket that was too big for his slight shoulders. He packed a pair of steel-toed rubber boots and two layers of gloves, because even a small tear could lead to a chemical burn. As others in the house slept, a cousin drove him to his cleaning shift at the chicken slaughterhouse, a half-mile-long industrial complex on a stretch of bare highway in rural Virginia, set behind hedges and a tall metal fence. "
Nebraska,2023.0,Q4,"The situation has left many patients frustrated and unable to start taking the weight loss drug. When Mark Basa needed his next dose of Wegovy, he worked his way down a list of 10 CVS stores within a 25-mile radius of his Peekskill, N.Y., home — and struck out at every one. In the 10 weeks he couldn’t find the drug, he regained the eight pounds he had lost on the medication, and his blood sugar rose. He felt himself get out of breath more often. His shirts fit tighter."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q4,"No matter how dark the days, we can find light in our own hearts, and we can be one another’s light. The mornings are dark, the late afternoons are dusky, and before we finish making dinner, the daylight is gone. As we approach the darkest days of the year, we’re confronted with the darkness of wars, a dysfunctional government, fentanyl deaths, mass shootings and reports of refugees crawling through the Darién Gap or floundering in small boats in the Mediterranean. And we cannot avoid the tragedy of climate change with its droughts, floods, fires and hurricanes. Indeed, the world is pummeled with misfortune."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q4,"A major government assessment lays out both the far-reaching perils of global warming and the cost-effective fixes that are available today. The food we eat and the roads we drive on. Our health and safety. Our cultural heritage, natural environments and economic flourishing. Nearly every cherished aspect of American life is under growing threat from climate change and it is effectively too late to prevent many of the harms from worsening over the next decade, a major report from the federal government has concluded."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q4,"A selection of stories that Times editors thought deserved more readers. Before the internet, there was no way for New York Times editors to know how many people had read an article.

Nebraska,2023.0,Q4,"President Biden campaigned on stopping construction of the border wall, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and ending the death penalty. As President Biden campaigns for re-election, Democrats have heralded a series of accomplishments under his tenure. At times, Mr. Biden has called attention to promises by his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, that fell short."

This term largely revolves around a single blockbuster question: Will our government retain the capacity to address the most pressing issues of our time?
Nebraska,2023.0,Q4,"Despite conflicts overseas and an approaching deadline to avert a government shutdown, Republicans are unable to rise above their internal divisions. Two key U.S. allies are engulfed in vicious wars. A disruptive government shutdown is looming in just over a month. Americans are held hostage overseas by hostile forces. Uncertainty ripples across the country."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q4,"Five years ago, David Buckel violently ended his life in a public park in Brooklyn. People who knew him were shocked and angry. Yet they refused to give up. They were walking up Ninth Street in Park Slope as they often did after work, each man a movie unto himself: one a crusading L.G.B.T.Q. rights attorney who quit the law to shovel dirt, the other a young man from the projects who became his most brilliant protégé."
Nebraska,2024.0,Q1,"The latest in a string of ambitious climate regulations aims to clean up the heaviest polluters on the road. But truckers are worried.

Nebraska,2024.0,Q2,"Compulsory labor with little or no compensation should be unthinkable. Today we celebrate Juneteenth, the day when word of the Emancipation Proclamation reached the farthest outpost in America. Many people do not realize that Emancipation did not legally end slavery in the United States, however. The 13th Amendment — the culmination of centuries of resistance by enslaved people, a lifetime of abolitionist campaigning and a bloody civil war — prohibited involuntary servitude “except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.”"

Nebraska,2024.0,Q2,"Also, Ukraine lowered its draft age. Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. World Central Kitchen, the charity group that paused its operations in Gaza this week after seven of its workers were killed in an Israeli strike, sent three ships with hundreds of tons of food meant for Gazans back to port in Cyprus.

Nebraska,2024.0,Q2,"How Donald Trump has slowed the cases against him.

We spend a lot of our lives working, especially in the United States — 40, 50, 60 or more hours a week. We hold multiple jobs to make ends meet. The candle is perpetually burning at both ends. Hard work, we’re told, is a virtue. It allows us to contribute to society and support our families, serve our employers well.

Nebraska,2024.0,Q3,"The folly of the Electoral College creates too many points where history could turn on narrow outcomes. For all the debates over our intractable political divisions and razor-thin vote margins, American presidential elections of late have not been particularly close. Since 2000, the average popular-vote margin is more than 4.6 million. That’s a lot of votes. The appearance that the outcomes are closer is an artifact of the Electoral College, specifically the winner-take-all method of awarding electors, which significantly magnifies the influence of a few arbitrary states."
Nebraska,2024.0,Q3,"They look after neighbors, they care about children and they take pride in the military. Republicans used to brag a lot about family values, but Donald Trump cooked that turkey when the G.O.P. traded moralizing for an immoral president."
Nebraska,2024.0,Q3,"The party’s candidates are likely to benefit from running alongside ballot measures to protect abortion rights.

Nebraska,2024.0,Q3,"Researchers have confirmed the presence of cocaine in sharks off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, though questions remain about the effects of the drug.

Nebraska,2024.0,Q3,"The Iowa Supreme Court ruled last month that the Republican-backed law could be enforced. Abortions had been legal in the state up until about 22 weeks. Iowa’s ban on abortions after roughly the sixth week of pregnancy took effect on Monday morning, changing the map of abortion access in the Midwest and giving Republicans in the state a long-sought policy victory."

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q1,"Literary novelists are struggling with whether, and how, to incorporate Covid into their fiction. Twelve years ago, Sigrid Nunez published “Salvation City,” a novel about a boy whose parents die from a mysterious respiratory illness.

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q2,"Standard political history may not be a good guide to 2022.  In November, the Democrats are widely expected to lose the House and probably also the Senate. Large defeats are the norm for a new president’s first midterm. A harbinger is a president’s approval rating, and President Biden’s stands at a lackluster 41.1 percent."

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q2,"“Silent Invasion,” an insider’s look at the Trump administration’s pandemic policies, is earnest and exhaustive, our reviewer says. On March 2, 2020, Dr. Deborah Birx took up her new position as coronavirus response coordinator within the White House Coronavirus Task Force. She was fresh off a plane from South Africa, where she had been busy in her sixth year as the global AIDS coordinator for the United States, overseeing the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a well-regarded and efficacious initiative begun by George W. Bush. The word “coordinator” is an equivocal title under the best of bureaucratic circumstances, let alone in the Trump White House, and amid the urgency of this new pandemic, arising to occlude the older one (AIDS), Birx had no time or opportunity to define the title before assuming it. She had said yes to “a job I didn’t seek but felt compelled to accept,” she recounts in “Silent Invasion.” She wasn’t the chair of this White House task force; Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, held that position until he was replaced after one month by Vice President Pence. Birx had an office in the West Wing but almost no staff, and her only leverage was persuasion. Her account of how that played out — it’s no spoiler to say, how poorly that played out — is earnest, exhaustive and excruciating."

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q3,"On abortion, climate change, guns and much more, two Americas — one liberal, one conservative — are moving in opposite directions.

He wasn’t very political — he didn’t vote in 2020, he said, because he thought Donald Trump was a “psycho” and Joe Biden was “corrupt.” It wasn’t until the pandemic that Whitney started regularly watching the news, but as he did, he felt that things weren’t adding up. He doubted what he called “the narrative” and struggled with the hostility his questions about vaccines and other mitigations elicited from those close to him. He described being “blamed and labeled as someone who’s part of the problem because you’re questioning. Like not taking a stance on it, but just questioning. That was the worst.”"

For nearly two years, poll after poll has found Americans in a sour mood about President Biden, uneasy about the economy and eager for younger leaders of the country."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"A group of politically vulnerable G.O.P. women has backed legislation that purports to expand birth control access but would have little effect. Critics say the bill is meant to distract from their anti-abortion stances. She had barely opened her town hall to questions when Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican from a competitive district in Iowa, was pressed to defend her opposition to abortion rights."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"Hoping to break through a crowded presidential field in 2024, the former Texas congressman is pitching himself as a modern and moderate Republican with a bipartisan vision.

After snow disrupted their flights, Will Hurd, the former Republican congressman, and Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat from a neighboring district, climbed into a rented Chevy Impala and took a cross-country road trip from their home state of Texas to Washington."

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, after the Supreme Court’s ruling. After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year, it looked like the number of abortions would soon plummet across the country. But new estimates suggest that has not happened. The number of legal abortions has held steady, if not increased, nationwide since 2020, our colleagues Amy Schoenfeld Walker and Allison McCann reported today."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"Senator Chuck Schumer’s move to clear the way for the confirmation of three top generals left unanswered the question of what would happen to hundreds of other military promotions. The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly confirmed Gen. Randy George of the Army and Gen. Eric Smith of the Marines as the chiefs of staff of their respective services, circumventing a single senator’s blockade against senior military promotions but leaving hundreds more still in limbo."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"PFAS lurk in so much of what we eat, drink and use. Scientists are only beginning to understand how they’re impacting our health — and what to do about them. The Faroe Islands, an incongruous speckling of green in the North Atlantic, are about as far away as you can hope to get on Earth from a toxic-waste dump, time zones distant from the nearest population centers (Norway to the east, Iceland to the west). Pál Weihe was born in the Faroes and has lived there for most of his life. He is a public-health authority for the nation, population around 53,000; chairman of the Faroese Medical Association and chief physician of the Department of Occupational Medicine and Public Health in the Faroese hospital system. He is also vice chairman of the Faroe Islands Art Society; a widower; a grandfather. A crumpled funeral program and half-empty juice boxes share space in the back seat of his Land Cruiser. "
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"For every devoted birder, there is a bird that continues to elude sighting. In the world of birding, Peter Kaestner stands alone. No one has seen and identified more birds than Mr. Kaestner, a retired U.S. diplomat who aspires to become the first birder to spot 10,000 of the planet’s roughly 11,000 avian species. With 9,697 on his eBird list so far, he is getting close."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"The Minnesota congressman made his presidential bid official in New Hampshire before a crowd of a few dozen people composed largely of journalists and campaign staff. On the last possible day to do so, Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota walked into the New Hampshire Statehouse on Friday through a side door and submitted paperwork to put his name on the state’s primary ballot."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"The downward slide of once-mighty presidential candidates usually starts after Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us. Which means that while Americans are recovering from an orgy of overeating and Black Friday shopping, the political world is easing into the next phase of the presidential election: primary crunchtime."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"Win or lose, Nikki Haley knows how to run. A long time ago in South Carolina, as Nikki Haley recalls when she talks to voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, she ran campaigns that nobody thought much of until, unexpectedly, suddenly, she was winning them. Is that what’s happening here? Is this real?"
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"The illness can include a cough, fever, lethargy and a loss of appetite. Veterinarians recommend that owners avoid boarding their dog if it shows symptoms.

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"Tough promises on immigration from Nikki Haley and her rivals for the Republican nomination face logistical and legal barriers. On the national debate stage, in interviews and at town halls, the message on immigration from every top Republican in the 2024 presidential race has resounded clearly: It is time to shut down the nation’s southern border."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"Businesses, schools and offices in the southern part of the state were closed on Thursday as the authorities sought a 40-year-old suspect. The familiar rituals of a Wednesday night were playing out at Just-In-Time Recreation, a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, with 22 lanes of tenpin and a restaurant serving nachos and wings."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"More than three dozen states and the District of Columbia accused the tech giant of knowingly using addictive features to draw in and retain children and teenagers. Meta was sued by more than three dozen states on Tuesday for knowingly using features on Instagram and Facebook to hook children to its platforms, even as the company said its social media sites were safe for young people."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q4,"As President Biden grapples with an unwieldy crisis at the southern border, his likely 2024 rival has leveled many criticisms — including some baseless and misleading claims. Former President Donald J. Trump has drawn widespread censure after reprising a line that casts undocumented immigrants as “poisoning the blood of our country.”"
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"Some of the most contentious issues in the country will dominate the agendas of state legislatures returning to work in the coming days and weeks. As Americans have engaged in fierce disagreement over gender expression and sexual orientation, the costs and reach of racism, and the danger and opportunity presented by rapid technological advancement, state legislatures have been one of the most visible and influential arenas for these debates."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"Also, fighting has eased in northern Gaza. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday. A near-total breakdown in policing protocols hindered the response to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022 that left 21 people dead, the Justice Department concluded today after a nearly two-year investigation."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"The candidate challenging President Biden “didn’t understand DEI until recently,” Mr. Ackman said. After an endorsement and super PAC donation, the Phillips campaign site changed course. The campaign website for Representative Dean Phillips, the Minnesota Democrat mounting a long-shot primary challenge to President Biden, has a policy platform that signals liberal bona fides tempered by a Midwestern businessman’s practicality. It includes headers like “Climate Action,” “Women’s Health and Economic Security” and “Immigration Reform.”"
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"The Democratic-allied Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy intends to lift President Biden and important House and Senate races. A liberal political organization that promotes economic policies for working families, the Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy, will spend $40 million backing President Biden’s re-election bid and other Democratic candidates for the House and Senate."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"Nearly a week before the state’s caucuses, a frenzy of campaigning belies a seemingly static G.O.P. race, with former President Donald J. Trump the prohibitive front-runner. Donald J. Trump’s escalating attacks on Nikki Haley both on the airwaves and at his rallies — criticisms she likened Saturday to “a temper tantrum” — captured the turbulent dynamics in the final week before the first votes of the 2024 Republican presidential primary are cast."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"The Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday on one of the biggest cases of the current term.

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"The former president shows no sign of being shaken from his controlling position in the G.O.P. — not in 2024, and not in the foreseeable future. The reality has been clear for weeks, since former President Donald J. Trump trounced his opponents across the frozen fields and icy highways of Iowa. But his overwhelming victory on Saturday in South Carolina, where he defeated Nikki Haley in her home state, makes it all but official."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q1,"Council chambers in Richmond, one of British Columbia’s largest cities, turned raucous this week amid debate over a possible safe consumption site. British Columbia’s rampant drug deaths have more than once thrust public health officials into uncharted territory. It became the first province to decriminalize small quantities of hard drugs for personal use in 2022, about two decades after Vancouver opened the first supervised injection site in North America. But as overdoses increase in some British Columbia towns, there is disagreement in one city about how to address it."

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"Mr. Kennedy has become the most prominent independent or third-party presence in the 2024 race. The independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has emerged as a wild card of the 2024 election, attracting a motley mix of ideologically diverse supporters, raising piles of cash and drawing legal attacks from Democrats and verbal barrages from former President Donald J. Trump."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"The spending blitz showcases the importance of state legislatures in 2024. Hi there. Today, my colleague Nick Corasaniti, who covers voting and elections, joins us with an exclusive look at the big money pouring into small races. Then, I ask whether a surprising election result last night in Ohio tells us anything about November. — Jess Bidgood"
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"Infected with ideological purity, the West Coast is focused more on intentions than on oversight and outcomes.

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"The police department charged with protecting lawmakers has brought in new attorneys specially responsible for prosecuting people who make violent threats against members of Congress. The Capitol Police, facing a flood of violent threats against members of Congress that is expected to rise with the upcoming November elections, have begun hiring prosecutors dedicated to going after people who threaten lawmakers."

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"How Donald Trump has slowed the cases against him. It now seems likely that Donald Trump will be able to run for president this year without having faced any legal penalties for his effort to overturn the last presidential election. To many of his supporters, of course, this outcome is just. But it is also striking."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"The group — the largest set of Americans retrieved from the war zone — was joined by a 9-year-old noncitizen whose brother is an American.

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"A wave of retirees from both parties, including committee chairs and rising stars, say that serving in Congress is no longer worth the frustration. At some point during a routine seven-hour trip from his Oregon district to Washington, Representative Earl Blumenauer, 75, a Democrat who has served in Congress for almost three decades, experienced a depressing epiphany."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q2,"Supposedly principled Republicans can’t reconcile condemnation of Trump with refusal to back Biden. I admired the vigor and even eloquence with which Chris Christie, quixotically campaigning for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, made the case against Donald Trump. And I wrote as much."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q3,"Ten communities are at high or critical risk from Eastern equine encephalitis, which killed a man in New Hampshire this month and sickened two people in Massachusetts and Vermont. Sue Ryan, who lives in Plymouth, Mass., is taking no chances."

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q3,"The outbreak, linked to Boar’s Head products, has been especially devastating for high-risk groups like pregnant women and older adults. Ashley Solberg wasn’t worried about the risk to her pregnancy when she bought Boar’s Head sliced ham from a Florida supermarket in May. Her doctor had told her the risk was negligible, Ms. Solberg said, and she’d eaten deli meat without any issues in her last pregnancy. So she used it to make a poolside lunch for her parents and toddler."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q3,"It’s probably not selfishness, experts say. Even young adults who want children see an increasing number of obstacles.

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q3,"We cover the history of White House health cover-ups. The scandal is almost as old as the United States itself: The president has a health problem that he and his aides try to shroud from the public. Only later — years later, in some cases — does the severity become clear."

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q4,"Joint events with an unpopular incumbent would “only hurt” the vice president at this stage of the campaign, as one of her advisers put it. But the president does not want to be sidelined.

New Hampshire,2024.0,Q4,"Voters have more opportunities than ever in 2024 to shape history in their countries, but war, technology and other forces pose a powerful threat, experts said. Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old far-right leader who nearly became France’s prime minister last summer, warned last week that his country’s existence was imperiled by Muslim migrants who shared the same militant Islamist ideology as the Hamas-led assailants who committed deadly attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q4,"President Biden did not attend Vice President Kamala Harris’s speech on Tuesday night, but his ill-timed flub in a video interview caused headaches for her campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris’s strategists may have thought they were avoiding problems by keeping President Biden holed up in the White House. But now they may need to take away his Zoom password, too."
New Hampshire,2024.0,Q4,"The vice president vacillated on how to talk about the economy, and ended up adopting marginal pro-business tweaks that both corporate and progressive allies agreed made for a muddled message. When Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to a locally owned brewery in New Hampshire to talk about helping small businesses — a major plank of her economic platform — she made sure that one group of Americans felt included: millionaires who wanted to keep more of their profits from selling stocks and real estate."
