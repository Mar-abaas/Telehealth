Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"The White House on Tuesday announced new steps to expand access to Paxlovid, the Covid-19 antiviral pill. But experts say that efforts to reach at-risk Americans remain complex and inefficient. GREENBELT, Md. — Last month, the owner of a small pharmacy here secured two dozen courses of Pfizer’s new medication for treating Covid-19, eager to quickly provide them to his high-risk customers who test positive for the virus."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"The virus “is not known to linger in the air,” agency officials said. But the research is far from definitive. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday pushed back against the idea that the monkeypox virus can spread through the air, saying the virus is usually transmitted through direct physical contact with sores or contaminated materials from a patient."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"But prior infection does not guarantee protection from the virus, officials said, and Americans should still get vaccinated and boosted. Sixty percent of Americans, including 75 percent of children, had been infected with the coronavirus by February, federal health officials reported on Tuesday — another remarkable milestone in a pandemic that continues to confound expectations."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"Buildings need to disinfect the air. At every stage of the pandemic, a disproportionate number of coronavirus infections have been traced to a relatively small number of gatherings, also known as superspreader events. The recent Gridiron dinner, after which over 70 people tested positive, including members of the Biden administration, is just the latest example."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"Nationwide, the number of kindergartners with the required shots fell below the target for broad immunity, raising fears of outbreaks of measles and other illnesses. Kindergartners in the United States fell behind on routine childhood vaccinations during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday, a slide that experts attributed to skipped checkups and to a groundswell of resistance to Covid-19 shots spilling into unease about other vaccines."
Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"Many parents have greeted the news that young children can soon be vaccinated against Covid with a sigh of relief. Others have deep reservations.

Maryland,2022.0,Q2,"The move in a religion case offers hope to those worried about the dominance of the court’s conservative majority. What a week so far for conservatives. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court struck down a Maine law that prohibited religious private schools from receiving taxpayer dollars. On Thursday, it invalidated a New York State gun safety law limiting the public carry of firearms. And on Friday, it overturned Roe v. Wade. The outcome in these cases was not surprising. The court has ruled in favor of religious litigants in an overwhelming number of cases; the gun case’s outcome was clear from the oral argument before the justices in November; and the court’s draft abortion decision was leaked in May."

Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"The student loan plan is the latest example of Democrats practicing the art of the possible on the nation’s most pressing economic challenges and ending up with risky or patchwork solutions. WASHINGTON — President Biden’s move this week to cancel student loan debt for tens of millions of borrowers and reduce future loan payments for millions more comes with a huge catch, economists warn: It does almost nothing to limit the skyrocketing cost of college and could very well fuel even faster tuition increases in the future."

Wade era."
Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"Experts say the U.S. government has unintentionally encouraged a dependency on imported masks by failing to promote elastomeric respirators, a reusable mask that is domestically produced.

Maryland,2022.0,Q3,"The shots from Novavax are only for people who have not yet been vaccinated, which is likely to limit their uptake at first.

When the doctors and nurses gave her medications or took her blood, she said, they gave her minimal explanation."
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"Nearly 6 percent of American teens and adults have cannabis use disorder. Smoking weed had always been a social activity for Julian. He first tried cannabis in high school, and as an adult he would smoke a couple of times a month with friends. But things changed after he moved to a new city where he didn’t know anyone. Julian (who asked not to use his last name when talking about a sensitive medical condition) didn’t have much of a social life, so he started smoking by himself to pass the time. “Weed became my friend,” he said. “I would get off work and I would smoke because I was bored.”"

Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"Lab safety doesn’t need to torpedo scientific progress. The 2007 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain was traced to a faulty drainage pipe at a research facility. In 2015 the Department of Defense discovered that a germ-warfare program in Utah had mistakenly mailed almost 200 samples of live anthrax over 12 years. In 2018 a burst pipe released as many as 3,000 gallons of wastewater from labs working with Ebola and anthrax at Fort Detrick in Maryland onto a grassy area a few feet from an open storm drain."
Maryland,2023.0,Q2,"The corporatization of health care has changed the practice of medicine, causing many physicians to feel alienated from their work. Some years ago, a psychiatrist named Wendy Dean read an article about a physician who died by suicide. Such deaths were distressingly common, she discovered. The suicide rate among doctors appeared to be even higher than the rate among active military members, a notion that startled Dean, who was then working as an administrator at a U.S. Army medical research center in Maryland. Dean started asking the physicians she knew how they felt about their jobs, and many of them confided that they were struggling. Some complained that they didn’t have enough time to talk to their patients because they were too busy filling out electronic medical records. Others bemoaned having to fight with insurers about whether a person with a serious illness would be preapproved for medication. The doctors Dean surveyed were deeply committed to the medical profession. But many of them were frustrated and unhappy, she sensed, not because they were burned out from working too hard but because the health care system made it so difficult to care for their patients."

Massachusetts,2020.0,Q3,"The rate at which people are lying during the pandemic has increased, experts suggest, perhaps because health-related matters are particularly difficult to share. As much of the United States moves toward reopening in phases, some people are enjoying little bites of pre-pandemic life, such as dining in restaurants, exercising in gyms and learning in classrooms. With the gradual return comes a set of intrusive health questions: Are you experiencing any symptoms? Have you been exposed to anyone who has tested positive for the coronavirus? Answering those questions is where it gets tricky."
Massachusetts,2020.0,Q4,"Even before the president was given mood-altering drugs, there was a movement to end the commander in chief’s sole authority to launch nuclear weapons. President Trump’s long rants and seemingly erratic behavior last week — which some doctors believe might have been fueled by his use of dexamethasone, a steroid, to treat Covid-19 — renewed a long-simmering debate among national security experts about whether it is time to retire one of the early inventions of the Cold War: the unchecked authority of the president to launch nuclear weapons."

Massachusetts,2021.0,Q2,"This phase of the pandemic, when adults can be vaccinated but young children cannot, is confusing for many families. As vaccinated Americans return to many parts of their prepandemic lives this summer, one group will be left out: children under 12, who cannot yet be vaccinated. So what should families with young children do when everyone else starts socializing again?"
Massachusetts,2021.0,Q2,"Researchers who receive federal help consistently fail to report their results to the public. The government should hold them accountable. In 2016, Joe Biden, then vice president, launched the Cancer Moonshot initiative, a project to identify new approaches for preventing and treating cancer.

Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"A federal plan to require health insurers to cover the cost of at-home tests is not yet in effect. But there are other options. Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced that it would soon require private health insurers to reimburse consumers for the cost of at-home coronavirus tests.

Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"People with markers for cancer often need more screenings. But health insurers are not required to fully cover them.  Tens of millions of Americans have received genetic tests illuminating their risk of disease, and a majority of adults in the United States say they would be interested in getting tested. When we each turned 20, we sought genetic testing to learn whether we had inherited our mother’s BRCA mutation, which significantly increases the risk of breast, ovarian and other cancers.

At this point in the pandemic, many Americans remain unvaccinated because they believe the coronavirus vaccine is unlikely to do them any good. They’re aware of the virus and the damage it can cause, but for any number of reasons, they simply don’t believe they should get a vaccine. We’ve spoken to patients like this in our practice, and we have observed in those conversations that providing more, frightening information intended to change their beliefs is ineffective for many or may even cause further entrenchment against vaccination."
Massachusetts,2021.0,Q4,"The agency has taken a controversial stand on vaping as a way to quit tobacco. This is what the research shows. When they first appeared in the United States in the mid-2000s, “electronic nicotine delivery systems” — e-cigarettes, vapes, e-liquids and other wares that contain the stimulant found in tobacco — were subject to little federal oversight. Their makers could incorporate countless other ingredients and flavorings. Like cigarettes before them, the devices proved extremely attractive to young people; in 2018, the surgeon general declared youth vaping an “epidemic” and noted that one in five high schoolers and one in 20 middle schoolers used e-cigarettes. Nicotine can harm the developing brain, and e-cigarettes contain potentially harmful toxins like heavy metals; the long-term effects of vaping — the heating of nicotine to create an inhaled aerosol — are uncertain."

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q3,"The most urgent step the federal government can take is to ensure access to medication abortion. Barely two weeks have passed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and already chaos reigns. Several states are moving to ban abortion almost completely, abortion-rights proponents are challenging those bans in court and in some cases, judges have been asked to issue injunctions that could, for a time, prevent the bans from going into effect."
Massachusetts,2022.0,Q3,"The former mayor will serve as a visiting fellow at institutes focused on health and politics at the university this fall.

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q3,"The sheer amount of tech tools and knowledge required to discreetly seek an abortion underlines how wide open we are to surveillance. Welcome to the post-Roe era of digital privacy, a moment that underscores how the use of technology has made it practically impossible for Americans to evade ubiquitous tracking."

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q3,"As people age, they get less satisfaction from travel, cars, clothes and appliances. If the recent rout in the stock market has you drastically cutting back your retirement spending plans, it probably means that you were counting too much on ever-rising asset prices. But a new research paper suggests that spending less at advanced ages is not necessarily a sign of failure to plan. Even people who plan perfectly do it."
Massachusetts,2022.0,Q4,"On Tuesday, the state’s voters overwhelmingly supported letting a two-year-old law take effect. The company’s lawsuit is viewed by anti-smoking advocates as a tactic that could keep menthol cigarettes on the market longer. R.J.

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q4,"Doctors and midwives in blue states are working to get abortion pills into red states — setting the stage for a historic legal clash. When Linda Prine learned she was pregnant in 1970, she was a first-year college student in Wisconsin, where abortion was largely illegal. The doctor who gave her the news saw the look on Prine’s face and handed her a slip of paper with a phone number. Prine waited until other students in her dorm left for class to call from a phone in the hallway. The woman she spoke to gave her the names of psychiatrists and told her to persuade them that she would be suicidal if she were to have a baby. Prine followed the instructions and was able to get an appointment for an abortion at the university hospital. "

Massachusetts,2022.0,Q4,"A small study demonstrated that deep brain stimulation, used for people with Parkinson’s disease, can limit an urge to overeat. What if an uncontrollable urge to rapidly eat large amounts of food is rooted in an impaired brain circuit? If that were the case, people who live with binge eating disorder — a psychiatric diagnosis — might be no more at fault for overeating than a patient with Parkinson’s disease is for their tremors."
Massachusetts,2022.0,Q4,"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said the administration was optimistic that “we’re not going to see a repeat of what we saw last year,” when the Omicron variant swept through the country.

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q1,"Republicans in Congress are seeking to capitalize on discontent about the federal coronavirus response while the party’s presidential contenders are vying to be the biggest foe of restrictions. WASHINGTON — Republicans on Tuesday pushed legislation through the House that would repeal vaccine mandates and declare the pandemic over, blowing past Democratic opposition in a broader drive to use the federal response to the coronavirus spread against President Biden and his party, stoking a culture war over a major public health challenge."
Massachusetts,2023.0,Q1,"The directors Jordan Tetewsky and Joshua Pikovsky offer a warm examination of what it means to do meaningful work in a world that undervalues it. The aimlessness of young adulthood is well-trodden ground in the world of indie cinema, but few movies offer the nuanced, lived-in portrayal seen in “Hannah Ha Ha.” The film follows the day-to-day life of Hannah (an illuminating Hannah Lee Thompson), a 25-year-old in small-town Massachusetts. She engages in odd jobs around the area, farming vegetables and teaching guitar lessons, while living with her aging father, Avram (Avram Tetewsky). Under the pressure of her rise-and-grind yuppie older brother, Paul (Roger Mancusi), who reminds her she’ll be booted off Dad’s health insurance on her impending 26th birthday, Hannah attempts to find herself a “real job,” first in the jargon-fueled tech world her brother occupies and then, after that fails, the service industry."
Massachusetts,2023.0,Q1,"Our use of antimicrobial cleaners spiked during the pandemic. Given the potential long-term health risks, it might be worth cutting back again. The cleaning industry experienced a boom during the first years of the pandemic. Covid-19 cleaning protocols in schools, stores and other public spaces ratcheted up, with a spray and a wipe-down becoming de rigueur on every surface after every use. Fear of the coronavirus also prompted people to use more disinfectant wipes and sprays in their homes, and consumer spending on cleaning products increased 12 percent between 2019 and 2021. (The New York Times admittedly contributed to this disinfecting frenzy.)"

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q2,"A man in his early 40s showed physical signs of the illness, but didn’t develop symptoms until he was nearly 70 because of a protective gene. The man should have gotten Alzheimer’s disease in his early 40s — he had a gene mutation that guaranteed it, or so it seemed. Scans of his brain even revealed severe atrophying and the hallmarks of the disease: rough, hard, amyloid plaques and spaghetti-like tangles of tau proteins. But the fatal brain disease did not appear until the man was 67."
Massachusetts,2023.0,Q2,Large health insurers and other companies are especially keen on doctors’ groups that care for patients in private Medicare plans. It’s no surprise that the shortage of primary care doctors — who are critically important to the health of Americans — is getting worse.
Massachusetts,2023.0,Q2,"Legal scholars say the ruling by a Texas judge, if upheld, could spur disputes over many medications and upend the drug industry’s reliance on the agency. A federal judge’s ruling to revoke the Food and Drug Administration’s longstanding approval of the abortion pill mifepristone poses threats to the U.S. government’s regulatory authority that could go far beyond one drug, legal experts say."
Massachusetts,2023.0,Q2,"Many police departments prohibit their officers from employing the kind of neck restraints a man used in fatally subduing Jordan Neely in the New York City subway. When a subway rider in New York used a chokehold that ended up killing a 30-year-old homeless man, Jordan Neely, he was employing a technique that many neurologists warn is so dangerous that it should not be allowed in law enforcement."
Massachusetts,2023.0,Q2,"Older Americans and those with weakened immune systems, groups still particularly vulnerable to the virus, may receive additional shots of the reformulated vaccine, federal officials said.

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q2,"Protection may last even longer, scientists reported. The finding may be a boon to low-income countries, where cervical cancer takes an enormous toll. A single dose of the human papillomavirus vaccine is highly effective at preventing infections over three years, most likely lowering rates of cervical cancer and other diseases linked to the virus, according to a new study in Kenya."

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q2,"And lessons for future outbreaks. For weeks, the same awkward scene played out again and again in sexually transmitted infection clinics across the United States. Half-naked gay men stood with their pants around their ankles while clinicians crouched between their legs, swabs at the ready. The clinicians were covered head-to-toe in hazmat chic: gowns, gloves, face shields and N95 respirators. The men were covered in something much worse: painful lesions, on their genitals, their anuses and sometimes even their faces and limbs."

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q3,"The siesta, a sacred afternoon break in Spain, was once mocked as lazy. But now, countries like Germany, which were among the siesta haters, are taking another look. A decade ago, in the wake of a financial crisis, Spain’s sacred siesta seemed to be under serious threat. Criticism was mounting across Europe that Spain’s sluggish economy resulted, in part, from its long midday break. Worried about being stereotyped as a sleepy, lazy country, Spain pledged to abolish the siesta to increase productivity."

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q3,"G.O.P. leaders acceded to the demands of ultraconservatives to use the annual defense policy bill to lodge cultural grievances and protest continued U.S. support for Ukraine. Now its fate is in doubt. A divided House voted on Thursday to restrict abortion access, bar transgender health services and limit diversity training for military personnel, potentially imperiling passage of the annual defense bill as Republicans, goaded by their right flank, loaded the measure with conservative policy dictates."
Massachusetts,2023.0,Q3,"In response to soaring overdose deaths in state prisons, California started a sprawling addiction program. But keeping people on medication during and after a sentence can be difficult.

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q4,"Times readers, ages 16 to 93, open up about feeling alone. The Opinion video above gives voice to the lonely. We are publishing it at the end of a year in which loneliness started getting the kind of attention it has long deserved — an effort led, in large part, by the surgeon general of the United States, Dr. Vivek Murthy. In a guest essay last spring, he revealed that he, too, had struggled with loneliness and said the nation was facing “an epidemic of loneliness and isolation.” Several days later, he issued a surgeon general advisory about the problem, calling it a “public health crisis” and outlining a strategy to confront it."

Massachusetts,2023.0,Q4,"While a narrative emerged that the pandemic indiscriminately struck the young and healthy, new evidence suggests that frail young adults were most vulnerable.

Michigan,2022.0,Q4,"The overturning of Roe v. Wade got people to the polls. Democrats must learn from that. Support for abortion rights appears to have been a major factor in the midterm elections, helping Democrats fare much better than expected in many places. Though Republicans seized control of the House, dashing hopes of federal legislation to codify Roe v. Wade in the next two years, the midterm results suggest that running on abortion can be a winning strategy for Democrats. The outcome offers lessons to Democrats looking ahead to a 2024 presidential election that could determine if a federal abortion ban is on the table."
Michigan,2022.0,Q4,"Shock and outrage over the fall of Roe v. Wade has faded as confusion has spread, deflating Democrats’ hopes that the issue could carry them to victory.

Michigan,2023.0,Q1,"‌The first comprehensive data on prison fatalities in the Covid era sheds new light on where and why prisoners were especially vulnerable.

We want to learn more about how the threat of gun violence has altered your life. As of mid-February, the Gun Violence Archive had counted 81 mass shootings in the United States in 2023.

Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"Across the nation’s middle, unhealthy air from Canadian wildfires sent summer campers home and left residents coughing, and asking when this would end. The Great Lakes region was enveloped in smoke and haze from Canadian wildfires for a second day on Wednesday, prompting millions of Americans to stay indoors in the heart of summer to avoid the unhealthy air."
Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"Fixing the background check system can be done today, but it will take work. A litany of exasperating rituals flows from America’s regular mass shootings. One of the most frustrating is the hand-wringing that our politics is so polarized that there’s no way to move forward."
Michigan,2023.0,Q2,Large health insurers and other companies are especially keen on doctors’ groups that care for patients in private Medicare plans. It’s no surprise that the shortage of primary care doctors — who are critically important to the health of Americans — is getting worse.
Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"The artificial intelligence tool, named Tessa, was presented by the National Eating Disorders Association as a way to discover coping skills.

Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"More than 1.1 million Americans have died of Covid. An official end to the health emergency has landed in complicated ways for those affected most acutely.

Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"Wegovy and other drugs expose a social tension between a quest to medicate illness and a stigmatizing belief that obese people lack sufficient willpower to lose weight. Eileen Isotalo was always able to lose weight, but always gained it back. Now 66, her first diet was with Weight Watchers at age 14. She went on to try one diet after another and bought so many books on weight loss that she thinks she has more than the public library."

Michigan,2023.0,Q2,"Democrats and abortion-rights leaders said the decision could be a catastrophe and used the moment to criticize Republicans, who remained relatively quiet on Friday. As Americans digested a Texas judge’s ruling on Friday night invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone — and a contradictory ruling from a Washington State judge ordering the F.D.A. to maintain its approval as is in some states — the divide in political reactions was as much between words and silence as it was between pro- and anti-abortion rights."

In 2012, 23 percent of such adults reported binge drinking."
Michigan,2023.0,Q3,"Like the smoke particles that seep into our homes through a window crack, the effects of fossil fuel pollution put nearly every child at risk.

Michigan,2023.0,Q3,"Ian Fishback, who left the Army with the rank of major, was a dissident-in-uniform who died at the age of 42 after entering a dizzying mental health spiral.

Michigan,2023.0,Q3,"After Dobbs, the political ground seems to be shifting in some unpredictable ways. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, abortion opponents celebrated.

Michigan,2023.0,Q3,"The United Auto Workers union said workers would walk out of more plants on Friday if it didn’t make progress in talks with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.

Kaiser Permanente health care workers were finishing a three-day strike on Friday, and were expected to return to work early Saturday morning without a new contract."
Michigan,2023.0,Q4,"While a narrative emerged that the pandemic indiscriminately struck the young and healthy, new evidence suggests that frail young adults were most vulnerable. The flu typically kills the very young, the old and the sick. That made the virus in 1918 unusual, or so the story goes: It killed healthy young people as readily as those who were frail or had chronic conditions."
Michigan,2023.0,Q4,"The virus sends up to 160,000 people over 65 to hospitals every year. But just 15 percent have gotten the newly available shots. Toby Gould was an early adopter. In September, Mr. Gould, 78, went to a pharmacy in Hyannis, Mass., to get one of the new vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus, known as R.S.V. He has asthma, which would heighten his risk of serious illness if he were to be infected."

Union officials say the job action — threatened for Wednesday — could be the largest strike by health care workers in recent U.S. history.

Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"In a new study, the health agency urges hospitals and surgeons to play a bigger role to help the world’s 1 billion smokers kick the habit. It goes without saying that cigarettes and surgery are not a winning combination. Scores of studies have shown that patients who use tobacco have poorer post-surgical outcomes. But many doctors give smokers conflicting advice on the ideal length of time they should go cold turkey before  their operations."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"Research over two decades on prairie land in western Minnesota shows how controlled burns encouraged a plant to generate seeds. As fires continue to rage across Australia, destroying ecosystems and killing millions of animals, it’s hard to imagine any good emerging from such devastation.

Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"Federal officials said many more drive-through testing sites, along with expanded processing of tests by commercial labs, would help ease a bottleneck. Federal officials are moving ahead with plans to address the screaming shortage of testing for the coronavirus by setting up many more drive-through testing centers around the country and speeding the capability of commercial laboratories to process multiple samples at once."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, Citibank and Bank of America are the worst offenders. WASHINGTON — If you asked us why a dozen people sat on the floor next to the A.T.M. in a Chase Bank branch on Friday, waiting for the police to arrest us for this small act of civil disobedience, we would come up with the same answer as the famous robber Willie Sutton: “Because that’s where the money is.”"
Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"The number of cases outside China is small, and the disease does not seem to be spreading within other countries. The World Health Organization on Thursday decided not to declare the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a global emergency, despite the spread of the dangerous respiratory infection from China to at least five other countries."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"Those with chronic health problems are more likely to develop severe illnesses and to die, research shows.

But they have stepped gingerly around advice for another group of Americans also at special risk from the infection: those with chronic health conditions."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"In wresting control of the administration’s haphazard response to the virus, Mike Pence has taken on a familiar role as the president’s political janitor. WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence has long been a one-man political cleanup crew for President Trump. From his day trip last fall to Turkey to negotiate a cease-fire in northern Syria to his takeover of the chaotic presidential transition, Mr. Pence is used to being diverted from his reliably anodyne schedule."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q1,"One policy proposal has defined this Democratic race. It’s time to move on. With strong support among the Democratic Party’s base, “Medicare for all” has emerged as a test of progressive bona fides in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination."

Or that’s what he’s been preparing for — by blanketing the country with one ad per every 15 seconds.
Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"Surgeries are canceled. Business models are shifting. Some of the hardest-hit hospitals may close, leaving patients with fewer options for care. When the top-ranked Mayo Clinic stopped all nonemergency medical care in late March, it began to lose millions of dollars a day."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"Ms. Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim women in Congress, sought asylum in the United States with her father in the 1990s. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, said late Monday that her father had died from complications of Covid-19."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"Social gatherings and campaign rallies like those planned by President Trump could spread infections this summer. People should wear masks and continue social distancing, public health researchers say. The coronavirus won’t be loosening its grip on the United States any time soon, leading infectious disease experts said on Sunday. They are also uncertain how the viral spread will be affected by the patchwork of states reopening businesses and by large events like protests and President Trump’s upcoming campaign rallies."

Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"In Ojibwe culture, music, dance and medicine are sources of healing. MINNEAPOLIS — From our first contact with Europeans to the present, Indigenous people have careened from one public health crisis to another. Our healing process and our historical memory of these moments should not end with vaccinations. Traditions of song and dance help restore the balance that is drained by bodily sickness and deliver spiritual sustenance to those who have lost loved ones. Art, in other words, allows us to survive."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"In large swaths of the U.S., people have a hard time reaching a hospital that offers the kind of inpatient care needed to treat the coronavirus. In large swaths of the U.S., people have a hard time reaching a hospital that offers the kind of inpatient care needed to treat the coronavirus."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"Spraying streets and inside buildings might calm a worried public, but it’s too early to know whether such efforts reduce transmission. The images are compelling: Fire trucks in Tehran or Manila spray the streets. Amazon tests a disinfectant fog inside a warehouse, hoping to calm workers’ fears and get them back on the job. TV commercials show health care workers cleaning chairs where blood donors sat. Families nervously wipe their mail and newly delivered groceries."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"A former Times columnist was struck by Rod Carew’s encounters with the police decades ago while playing with the Twins, and his outlook now on the legacy of the former owner Calvin Griffith. The tumult of recent weeks has made my thoughts turn to Rod Carew, whose past life as a Minnesota Twin speaks to present days in Minneapolis, and the country."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q2,"The move would have made it easier for people who have recently lost jobs to obtain health insurance.

Cuomo of New York has repeatedly complained that his state has been shortchanged by the $2 trillion economic stabilization package passed last month.
Minnesota,2020.0,Q3,"He was known for taking on difficult cases, many involving children. An anti-rejection drug he developed led to a scandal, but he was vindicated. Dr. John S.

Minnesota,2020.0,Q3,"The Tennessee Titans and Minnesota Vikings are the N.F.L.’s first teams to halt operations after eight members of the Titans received positive tests. After an auspicious beginning to the N.F.L. regular season played during a pandemic, the league got news of its first coronavirus outbreak after Week 3’s games."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q3,"Minnesota’s governor said the State Patrol and National Guard were headed to the city to help restore order, and the mayor ordered an immediate curfew.

"
Minnesota,2020.0,Q3,"Governors were closing bars — again — in some states as coronavirus clusters emerged. Even federal health officials have pointed to bars as a problem. When the bars in Michigan reopened in June, Tony Hild forgot about face masks, social distancing and caution and headed out to Harper’s Restaurant and Brewpub, a popular spot in the college town of East Lansing. There was a line out the door. Inside were 200 people dancing, drinking and shouting over the music."
Minnesota,2020.0,Q3,"To save lives, and save the economy, we need another lockdown. In just weeks we could almost stop the viral fire that has swept across this country over the past six months and continues to rage out of control. It will require sacrifice but save many thousands of lives."

Minnesota,2020.0,Q3,"Current tests have a high rate of false negative or false positive results.

Minnesota,2020.0,Q3,"Schools, forced to cancel in-person classes because of the pandemic, have become more comfortable with remote teaching. That might mean the end of the snow day.

Minnesota,2020.0,Q4,"Frontline medical personnel in hospitals and nursing homes are urging the incoming Biden administration to use the Defense Production Act to increase manufacturing of personal protective equipment. As Americans celebrate the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine, many of the doctors and nurses first in line for inoculation say a victory lap is premature. They fear that the optimism stirred by the vaccine will overshadow a crisis that has drawn scant public attention in recent months: the alarming shortage of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., that has led frontline medical workers to ration their use of the disposable gloves, gowns and N95 respirator masks that reduce the spread of infection."

FULLERTON, Calif. — The post-Thanksgiving rush for coronavirus testing is on: Pharmacies in the Southern California suburbs are advising customers lucky enough to score appointments that it could be four days before they receive results.

Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"The nation uses an enormous number of animals for commercial purposes, and regulations do not adequately protect against outbreaks, experts concluded. The United States is home to an enormous array of animal industries — including industrial agriculture, fur farming and the exotic pet trade — that pose a significant risk of creating infectious disease outbreaks in humans, according to a new report by experts at Harvard Law School and New York University. Moreover, the nation “has no comprehensive strategy” to mitigate the dangers posed by these practices, many of which operate with little regulation and out of public view, the authors concluded."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"The woman had sought medical help for over an hour before giving birth, officials said.

Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"Some doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are fleeing restrictive abortion laws. Idaho has been particularly hard hit. One by one, doctors who handle high-risk pregnancies are disappearing from Idaho — part of a wave of obstetricians fleeing restrictive abortion laws and a hostile state legislature.

Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate some drug prices, a change that the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans have opposed for decades. As he heads toward a re-election campaign next year, President Biden is betting that his success in pushing for policies intended to lower health care costs for millions of Americans will be rewarded by voters at the ballot box."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"The agency said it had found thousands of cases where minors were employed in illegal, often dangerous jobs. Congress has accused the health secretary of failing to protect them.

Minnesota,2023.0,Q3,"Here’s why that’s a problem, and how to fix it. Decades of research have shown that fiber-rich diets offer a range of health benefits, including healthier guts, longer lives and reduced risks of chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer."

Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The federal government needs to stop penalizing programs that help addicts safely consume their drugs while providing treatment. It’s been two years since New York City became home to the nation’s first legally sanctioned supervised consumption program, where people can take illicit drugs like heroin, crack and methamphetamine under medical supervision. By many accounts that program is thriving. More than 1,000 potentially fatal overdoses have been reversed and many people who use the facilities have been connected to support services, including addiction treatment."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The facilities can look like luxury apartments or modest group homes, and can vary in pricing structures. Here’s a guide. Are you confused about what an assisted-living facility is, and how it differs from a nursing home? And what you can expect to pay? Here’s a guide to this type of housing for older people."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The add-ons pile up: $93 for medications, $50 for cable TV. Prices soar as the industry leaves no service unbilled. The housing option is out of reach for many families. Assisted-living centers have become an appealing retirement option for hundreds of thousands of boomers who can no longer live independently, promising a cheerful alternative to the institutional feel of a nursing home."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"The condition can cause fatigue and other symptoms but is rarely tested for. Here’s what to know. Roughly 35 percent of women of reproductive age in the United States don’t have sufficient amounts of iron in their bodies. And yet the nutritional deficiency, which can affect multiple functions, from immunity to cognition, often goes undiagnosed, said Dr. Malcolm Munro, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. This oversight is partly because symptoms can be difficult to pin down but also because iron deficiency is rarely recognized as an urgent condition with short- and long-term consequences, he said."
Minnesota,2023.0,Q4,"Doxycycline can help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Here’s how to use it. As sexually transmitted infections continue to climb in the United States, a promising tool to combat them is drawing more attention.

Mississippi,2020.0,Q1,"In state after state, voters say they support liberal policies like single-payer health care, canceling student debt and the Green New Deal. But many are voting for Joe Biden, who has proposed largely moderate ideas. This was supposed to be the presidential primary race in which the progressive wing of the Democratic Party put it all together. The left was coming for power, not only moral victories. One popular podcast promised that the party’s moderates would soon “bend the knee,” as working Americans flocked to a left-wing presidential agenda."
Mississippi,2020.0,Q1,"After months of legislative inactivity, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has scheduled votes on two abortion-related bills. Democrats argue they are attacks on women’s reproductive rights.

Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin are among the states with rising cases, hospitalizations and intensive care occupancy, and hospitalization rates among younger people are increasing nationally.

Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"Being denied an abortion can have serious consequences for a woman’s health and livelihood. It can even be deadly. On Dec. 1, the Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court decides to uphold the Mississippi law — as it may well do — that would mean American abortion rights would no longer be protected up to the point of fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade established a right to abortion up until the point in a pregnancy when a fetus could survive outside the womb. For decades, that point of viability was considered to be about 24 weeks into a pregnancy. The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade established a right to abortion up until the point in a pregnancy when a fetus could survive outside the womb. For decades, that point of viability was considered to be about 24 weeks into a pregnancy."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"The chief justice, known for his incremental approach to contentious issues, explored on Wednesday whether the court could uphold Mississippi’s law without totally throwing out Roe v. Wade. WASHINGTON — Much of the discussion of a Mississippi law that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy has suggested that the Supreme Court faces a binary choice: it could strike down the law and fully reaffirm Roe v. Wade, as the law’s challengers want, or it could gut the idea that the Constitution protects abortion rights at all, as Mississippi has urged."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"The trend is toward liberalizing reproductive freedom, not repressing it.  Update, May 3, 2022: A majority of Supreme Court justices has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to a Politico article on Monday night citing what it said was a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito. This guest essay was published in December, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the abortion case now before the court.The decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case currently before the Supreme Court which focuses on the question of Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, is unlikely to hinge on global data or the finer points of international law. And yet a growing cadre of briefing papers, political accords and court filings is co-opting the language of international human rights groups to argue against the basic rights and freedoms that most Americans have enjoyed for decades."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"As vaccination spread and cases fell, people suffered fewer symptoms than in late 2020, but anxiety and depression were still far more prevalent than before pandemic. The arrival of vaccines and declining Covid-19 cases in the first half of 2021 coincided with an easing of symptoms of anxiety and depression across the United States, according to survey data released on Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"I thought we had more time before the 1973 decision was overturned. I now believe  I was wrong. As someone who has spent my career studying the history of abortion, I thought I knew what to expect tuning into Wednesday’s oral arguments in the Supreme Court abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. It was clear that big changes were coming to U.S. abortion law, no matter what. The Mississippi law at issue bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even though Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey recognize a right to choose abortion significantly later in pregnancy. So if the court sides with Mississippi in this case — as it is widely expected to do — then American abortion rights will be fundamentally undermined."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"Both sides anticipate that a Supreme Court decision scaling back abortion rights would roil next year’s elections, with Democrats sensing an advantage. WASHINGTON — A Supreme Court ruling to weaken or overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in the middle of next year’s midterm election campaign would immediately elevate abortion rights into a defining issue and most likely reinvigorate efforts to overhaul the court itself."
Mississippi,2021.0,Q4,"Black Americans were once far less likely than white Americans to be vaccinated. But a wave of pro-vaccine campaigns and a surge of virus deaths have narrowed that gap, experts say. TUSKEGEE, Ala. — By the time vaccines for the coronavirus were introduced late last year, the pandemic had taken two of Lucenia Williams Dunn’s close friends. Still, Ms. Dunn, the former mayor of Tuskegee, contemplated for months whether to be inoculated."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"F.D.A. inspectors said that a fumigation of the West Memphis, Ark., distribution center last month revealed more than 1,100 dead rodents. A far-reaching recall has been issued for stores in six states. The value-store chain Family Dollar said on Saturday that it had temporarily closed more than 400 stores after the discovery of a rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions at a distribution center in Arkansas touched off a far-reaching recall of food, dietary supplements, cosmetics and other products."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"With a Supreme Court ruling looming, both parties expect the issue to resonate in this year’s midterm elections. WASHINGTON — Republicans on Monday blocked the Senate from taking up sweeping abortion rights legislation as Democrats sought to put lawmakers on the record on the issue in advance of the midterm elections and a coming Supreme Court ruling on access to abortion."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"It never quite fit in your wallet, so it’s no surprise you may have misplaced it by now. More than a year ago, when Covid-19 vaccines became available and jabs started going into arms, it became a point of pride for some people to show off a bandaged shoulder and a white Covid-19 Vaccination Record card."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"Analyzing wastewater can help officials estimate how prevalent the virus is in a community and which variants are circulating. More than a year after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established its National Wastewater Surveillance System, the agency added wastewater data to its Covid-19 data tracker on Friday, providing a quick glimpse of whether the levels of coronavirus are rising or falling in hundreds of communities across the country."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"The rapid spread of the variant means far more people will have some immunity, at least for now, which might bode well this year for highly vaccinated countries in Europe. The astonishing spread of the Omicron variant could help set the stage for the pandemic to transition from overwhelming to manageable in Europe this year, a top health official said on Monday, potentially offering the world a glimpse at how countries can ease restrictions while keeping the virus at bay."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"The legislation is modeled after an abortion law in Mississippi that the Supreme Court appears poised to uphold in a ruling expected this summer. MIAMI — Florida legislators voted to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy on Thursday, a move that would severely restrict access to the procedure in a state that for decades has been a refuge for women from across the South."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"Getting more young school-age children vaccinated is crucial for ending the pandemic, public health officials say, and many are focusing on that group.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q1,"The annual March for Life rally is taking on a celebratory tone this year as participants expect the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"The landmark decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion has been contentious since it was made in 1973.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"The state passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country in 2019. But it has never been enforced, pending court decisions. In 2019, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, effectively outlawing the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy. But the measure has never been enforced. That could soon change."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"The Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v.

Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,Women across the nation react with anger and fear. One says she feels the “nation is on fire.” Our reporters are speaking with women across the United States as they react to Friday’s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Here is a selection of what they have heard from women who support maintaining access to abortion.
Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,The request for federal employees to be granted time off to travel out of state for the procedure comes as large companies are starting to make accommodations in the area. WASHINGTON — Justice Department employees pressed the Biden administration on Wednesday to grant federal employees time off if they or their family members need to travel out of state to obtain abortions.
Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"A new survey of the nation’s abortion providers found increases in every region of the country from 2017 to 2020. The number of abortions in the United States has increased, reversing what had been a three-decade decline, according to a new report."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"Those who fought for America’s democracy should be treated as the war heroes they are. History books have called my father an activist, a community organizer, a freedom fighter, among other things. But they don’t use a phrase that my dad has used to describe himself: a war general."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"She was an artist who was studying anthropology when she became an activist in the civil rights movement and a rare woman to document Black life in photos. Doris Derby, an educator, artist, activist and civil rights era photographer who turned her camera away from the violence of the times to capture the quieter moments of the movement, and in so doing documented the transformation of Black life in rural Mississippi, died on March 28 in Atlanta. She was 82."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q2,"The measure is part of a wave of stringent abortion restrictions enacted by legislators in Republican-led states. Lawmakers in Oklahoma on Tuesday approved a near-total ban on abortion, making it the latest Republican-led state to forge ahead with stringent abortion legislation as the Supreme Court weighs a case that could overturn Roe v. Wade later this year."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"The cap for private insurers was widely viewed as a violation of the strict budgetary rules that govern the reconciliation process Democrats are using to fast-track the package. Senate Republicans on Sunday forced the removal of a Democratic proposal that would have capped insulin prices at $35 for private insurers, even as seven Republicans joined all 50 members of the Democratic caucus in an effort to preserve the provision in the climate, tax and health care spending bill."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"The fast-changing status in the state is emblematic of the chaotic national landscape that has unfolded in the two weeks since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. A judge in Louisiana allowed state laws banning nearly all abortions to take effect on Friday, lifting an earlier court decision that had temporarily blocked them."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"Realizing that it’s not something you buy off the shelf. A few weeks ago, both my daughters had eczema flare-ups. This is common for my younger daughter, who will get red, itchy patches on the backs of her knees and elbows throughout the year. My older daughter hadn’t had it since she was a baby, yet there it was, an angry stripe on the inner curve of her neck. The usual remedies of diligent moisturizing and lukewarm baths were not working."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"The most urgent step the federal government can take is to ensure access to medication abortion. Barely two weeks have passed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and already chaos reigns. Several states are moving to ban abortion almost completely, abortion-rights proponents are challenging those bans in court and in some cases, judges have been asked to issue injunctions that could, for a time, prevent the bans from going into effect."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"Battles over laws related to abortion, like criminalizing out-of-state travel for the procedure, will intensify in the legal system.  While laying waste to 50 years of abortion jurisprudence, the Supreme Court — or at least four of the five members of the new hard-right majority — took pains to reassure the country that it had executed an isolated hit on an “egregiously wrong” precedent that would not reverberate in other areas of constitutional law."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"Federal officials are not relying on an established system to distribute the vaccine, slowing immunizations and burdening local health departments, critics say. Roughly 5,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine intended for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., left the national stockpile’s warehouse in Olive Branch, Miss., on July 19. They somehow ended up in Oklahoma."
Mississippi,2022.0,Q3,"As people age, they get less satisfaction from travel, cars, clothes and appliances. If the recent rout in the stock market has you drastically cutting back your retirement spending plans, it probably means that you were counting too much on ever-rising asset prices. But a new research paper suggests that spending less at advanced ages is not necessarily a sign of failure to plan. Even people who plan perfectly do it."

Mississippi,2023.0,Q1,"By acting as a reluctant regulator, the E.P.A. has left people at the site of the derailment desperate for answers. When a Norfolk Southern train carrying nearly 116,000 gallons of vinyl chloride derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, last month, local officials made a pivotal decision: to drain the highly toxic chemical into a ditch and set it on fire in a “controlled burn” to avoid a catastrophic explosion."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q1,The bills would tighten the current 15-week limit and offer narrow exceptions. Gov. Ron DeSantis said he welcomed “pro-life legislation.” Florida Republicans introduced parallel bills on Tuesday in the House and Senate that would further restrict the state’s abortion ban to six from 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Mississippi,2023.0,Q1,"The cancer-causing chemical vinyl chloride was vented and burned after the Ohio train crash to avoid an explosion. The United States should phase it out. Like a scene out of some postapocalyptic movie, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio convened a news conference on Feb. 5 to deliver a stark warning. “We are ordering them to leave,” he said of residents of the small rural community of East Palestine, Ohio, and a neighboring part of Pennsylvania. “This is a matter of life and death.” To emphasize the point, he added: “Those in the red area are facing grave danger of death if they are still in that area.”"
Mississippi,2023.0,Q1,"The group, the MAGA Inc. super PAC, accused Gov. Ron DeSantis of violating Florida laws by operating a shadow presidential campaign. A DeSantis spokeswoman called it a politically motivated attack. Donald J.

Mississippi,2023.0,Q1,"The mass, known as the great Atlantic Sargassum belt, is drifting toward the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists say seaweed is likely to come ashore by summer to create a rotting, stinking, scourge.

Spanning thousands of miles, it is so large that it can be seen from outer space."
Mississippi,2023.0,Q2,"Missouri has imposed sweeping rules to limit health care for trans adults. Other states have banned Medicaid coverage or introduced bills outlawing care for young adults.

KENNESAW, Ga. — Former Vice President Mike Pence brought a closing message to Gov.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q2,"Democratic interference in Republican primaries paid off in some places but not others, election-denying candidates were halted in Colorado, and incumbents proved their staying power.

WASHINGTON — The decision of the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, to try for a negotiated compromise on new gun laws in the wake of the latest pair of mass shootings may prove to be a high-stakes bet on representative democracy itself, made at a time when faith in Congress — and the Senate in particular — is in tatters in both parties."
Nebraska,2022.0,Q3,"Worried about inflation and dissatisfied with President Biden, many moderate women have been drifting away from Democrats.

But it met with a rocky reception in the Senate.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q4,"The overturning of Roe v. Wade got people to the polls. Democrats must learn from that. Support for abortion rights appears to have been a major factor in the midterm elections, helping Democrats fare much better than expected in many places. Though Republicans seized control of the House, dashing hopes of federal legislation to codify Roe v. Wade in the next two years, the midterm results suggest that running on abortion can be a winning strategy for Democrats. The outcome offers lessons to Democrats looking ahead to a 2024 presidential election that could determine if a federal abortion ban is on the table."

StoneBridge Christian Church in eastern Nebraska is known locally for hosting a big annual fireworks event, which this fall included 15 food trucks and portable firepits for making s’mores. But it’s the Christmas season that is “our Super Bowl,” said the church’s executive pastor, Mitch Chitwood.

Nebraska,2022.0,Q4,"Doctors and midwives in blue states are working to get abortion pills into red states — setting the stage for a historic legal clash. When Linda Prine learned she was pregnant in 1970, she was a first-year college student in Wisconsin, where abortion was largely illegal. The doctor who gave her the news saw the look on Prine’s face and handed her a slip of paper with a phone number. Prine waited until other students in her dorm left for class to call from a phone in the hallway. The woman she spoke to gave her the names of psychiatrists and told her to persuade them that she would be suicidal if she were to have a baby. Prine followed the instructions and was able to get an appointment for an abortion at the university hospital. "

Trump. WASHINGTON — The House floor has been no stranger to rowdy spectacle in 2023, but the eruptions of Republican vitriol against President Biden during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night underscored a new and notably coarse normal in Congress, where members of the G.O.P. majority tossed aside rules of decorum and turned the annual speech into a showcase for partisan hostility."

Nebraska,2023.0,Q1,"What happened to a state known for its political independence? The fifth season of the hit show “Yellowstone” premiered on the Sunday after the midterm elections, with Kevin Costner’s character, the rancher John Dutton, assuming Montana’s governorship. “This was never my plan,” he says, wearing a cowboy hat outside the State Capitol building in Helena. Dutton has reluctantly entered politics in part to stop an influx of rich outsiders he believes are transforming his home. In the last three years, Montana has become the second-fastest-growing state in the nation, largely because of the arrival of wealthy transplants. Unlike Dutton, many influential figures in the state’s real Republican Party have welcomed them, sometimes calling them “political refugees” fleeing blue states. Montana’s actual governor, the Republican Greg Gianforte, is himself a multimillionaire who was raised in Pennsylvania. Since assuming office in 2021, Gianforte has presided over this period of demographic change and economic growth, which has coincided with a hard shift to the right in state politics."

On Tuesday, I wrote about the Republican effort to limit the reach and scope of initiatives and referendums as another instance of the party’s war on majority rule.

While the company claimed its beverage would “give you wings,” it never said it was actually good for people."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"The case had been closely watched as an important test of whether bans on transition care for minors, enacted by more than a dozen states, could withstand challenges.

Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"House G.O.P. lawmakers in competitive seats who could be crucial to averting a catastrophic default are being fawned over by Democrats one minute and pummeled the next.

Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"As DeSantis announces his campaign, we dig into what may be the single most important fact about U.S. politics. If Ronald Reagan were to come back to life, he would probably be confused by the leftist tone that the early 2024 Republican presidential campaign has sometimes taken."
Nebraska,2023.0,Q2,"With single-party statehouse control at its highest level in decades, legislators across much of the country leaned into cultural issues and bulldozed the opposition.

Nebraska,2023.0,Q3,"American women are seeking help from Mexico for abortions, crystallizing the shifting policies of two nations that once held vastly different positions on the procedure. The text message Cynthia Menchaca received this summer was one she was seeing more and more: A woman living in Texas said she had left a violent relationship only to discover she was pregnant, and she desperately wanted an abortion.

The costumed cast of four was acting and singing up a storm in real time and on real sets, backed by an actual four-piece band. The retro, pastel-colored jukebox musical popped.

In January 2020, while I was in New Hampshire canvassing for Elizabeth Warren, a campaign organizer urged me to tell voters why I supported her.

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q2,"“Silent Invasion,” an insider’s look at the Trump administration’s pandemic policies, is earnest and exhaustive, our reviewer says. On March 2, 2020, Dr. Deborah Birx took up her new position as coronavirus response coordinator within the White House Coronavirus Task Force. She was fresh off a plane from South Africa, where she had been busy in her sixth year as the global AIDS coordinator for the United States, overseeing the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a well-regarded and efficacious initiative begun by George W. Bush. The word “coordinator” is an equivocal title under the best of bureaucratic circumstances, let alone in the Trump White House, and amid the urgency of this new pandemic, arising to occlude the older one (AIDS), Birx had no time or opportunity to define the title before assuming it. She had said yes to “a job I didn’t seek but felt compelled to accept,” she recounts in “Silent Invasion.” She wasn’t the chair of this White House task force; Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, held that position until he was replaced after one month by Vice President Pence. Birx had an office in the West Wing but almost no staff, and her only leverage was persuasion. Her account of how that played out — it’s no spoiler to say, how poorly that played out — is earnest, exhaustive and excruciating."

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q4,"The narrator of “Goblin,” a story in Rachel Harrison’s horror collection, “Bad Dolls,” has signed up for a very bad app indeed. Rachel Harrison’s feminist horror novels are some of the most original and entertaining out there, and her collection of stories, BAD DOLLS (Berkley, ebook, $2.99), is right up there with her longer works.

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q4,"Colby-Sawyer in New Hampshire has reduced its tuition to $17,500 a year, from about $46,000. But the cut is also a recognition that few pay the list price.

New Hampshire,2022.0,Q4,"Snowshoeing is a strenuous, affordable antidote to cabin fever. If you’re like a growing number of people, your holiday gift haul might include a pair of snowshoes. Some 3.6 million Americans took part in the sport in the winter of 2019-2020, and that was before the surge in outdoor activities brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. As snow hits the ground in record-breaking amounts in some parts of the country, now is a good time to give the sport a try."

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q1,"It is not what he says when he’s on the air. On Tuesday evening, two news reports caught my attention. The first was an Emerson College poll of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire. Donald Trump holds an incredible 41-point lead over Ron DeSantis in the state that rescued Trump’s primary campaign after a second-place finish in Iowa in 2016. This result is in line with a series of national polls that also show Trump with a large lead over DeSantis. Trump is still the favorite to win the G.O.P. nomination. Any other conclusion at this early date is wishful thinking."

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q1,"Republican legislators in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Alaska are pushing back against it much more forcefully than Kevin McCarthy.

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q1,"Anti-trans legislation in dozens of states is an attack on parental rights. JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Russel Neiss glanced down at his Apple Watch.

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q1,"Now that college players are allowed to cut sponsorship deals, some of them are raking in the money — but at what cost to the rest? One day last October, Bubba Cunningham, the athletic director at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, made the short walk from his office to the Dean E. Smith Center, where the men’s basketball team was holding a noon practice, and took a seat at one end of the stands. He wanted to see how the Tar Heels were coming together for the upcoming season, though he already had an idea: The Associated Press ranked them first in the nation in its preseason poll. Cunningham watched the starters run plays against imaginary defenses. Most of those plays ended with a guard, either Caleb Love or R.J. Davis, making a bounce pass to Armando Bacot, who laid the ball into the basket."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q2,"The people who believe he is going to save America. Before Covid, Gabe Whitney, a 41-year-old from West Bath, Maine, didn’t think much about vaccines. He wasn’t very political — he didn’t vote in 2020, he said, because he thought Donald Trump was a “psycho” and Joe Biden was “corrupt.” It wasn’t until the pandemic that Whitney started regularly watching the news, but as he did, he felt that things weren’t adding up. He doubted what he called “the narrative” and struggled with the hostility his questions about vaccines and other mitigations elicited from those close to him. He described being “blamed and labeled as someone who’s part of the problem because you’re questioning. Like not taking a stance on it, but just questioning. That was the worst.”"

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q2,"Vivek Ramaswamy, a long-shot 2024 contender, is lavishly wealthy and astoundingly confident. He also promises to exert breathtaking power in ways that Donald Trump never did.

Penny, a 3-year-old sorrel mare with a white blaze, had been slobbering her feed and fighting her bit, signs of a likely toothache.

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q2,"Mr. Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina weighing a 2024 bid, told a questioner that the president deserves to be criticized on his policies, not his age. During a town hall on Monday at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina received a question about President Biden’s fitness for office, putting his stated desire to run a positive campaign to the test. Mr. Scott, who is expected to formally begin his presidential campaign at the end of the month, offered an answer that criticized Mr. Biden on the merits of his leadership, rather than his age or mental fitness."

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q2,"Mr. Christie left the governor’s office in New Jersey and set out to, as he put it, “make money.” He successfully traded on his political profile — and on his ties to the man he now wants to defeat. As his second term as governor of New Jersey drew to a close in 2017, Chris Christie was characteristically blunt about his plans."

But her pleas for common sense and experience in the White House often leave crowds wanting more."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"The bipartisan group, facing enormous opposition from Democrats, hopes a new policy document will advance its political cause — and possible third-party White House run.

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"Despite a flood of negative polls for Democrats, the party has delivered a string of strong results in special elections, which can be a useful gauge of the national political environment. For nearly two years, poll after poll has found Americans in a sour mood about President Biden, uneasy about the economy and eager for younger leaders of the country."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"A group of politically vulnerable G.O.P. women has backed legislation that purports to expand birth control access but would have little effect.

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"Hoping to break through a crowded presidential field in 2024, the former Texas congressman is pitching himself as a modern and moderate Republican with a bipartisan vision.

New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"Senator Chuck Schumer’s move to clear the way for the confirmation of three top generals left unanswered the question of what would happen to hundreds of other military promotions.

Eric Smith of the Marines as the chiefs of staff of their respective services, circumventing a single senator’s blockade against senior military promotions but leaving hundreds more still in limbo."
New Hampshire,2023.0,Q3,"PFAS lurk in so much of what we eat, drink and use. Scientists are only beginning to understand how they’re impacting our health — and what to do about them. The Faroe Islands, an incongruous speckling of green in the North Atlantic, are about as far away as you can hope to get on Earth from a toxic-waste dump, time zones distant from the nearest population centers (Norway to the east, Iceland to the west). Pál Weihe was born in the Faroes and has lived there for most of his life. He is a public-health authority for the nation, population around 53,000; chairman of the Faroese Medical Association and chief physician of the Department of Occupational Medicine and Public Health in the Faroese hospital system. He is also vice chairman of the Faroe Islands Art Society; a widower; a grandfather. A crumpled funeral program and half-empty juice boxes share space in the back seat of his Land Cruiser. "

No one has seen and identified more birds than Mr. Kaestner, a retired U.S. diplomat who aspires to become the first birder to spot 10,000 of the planet’s roughly 11,000 avian species. With 9,697 on his eBird list so far, he is getting close."
